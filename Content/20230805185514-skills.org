Life is boring if you're boring. This node keeps track of auxiliary skills (don't take too long to learn/progress with daily) that I would like to add to my repertoire.

* The List
 - Juggling
 - Flipping food (omelets)
 - Being kind without trying hard
 - Identifying constellations
 - conducting casual interviews
