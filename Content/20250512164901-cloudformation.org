* Overview


-   CloudFormation is an [[id:52c69951-3bcb-4aa8-9529-f18af61d46ff][Infrastructure as Code]] (IaC) service offered by AWS.
-   It allows users to define AWS resources using templates.
-   Templates are written in either [[id:7cd81a80-dbc4-4c6e-860a-f05b14798e68][YAML]] or [[id:48581776-0ba5-4d88-ad38-25c0cb90595f][JSON]].
-   CloudFormation manages the provisioning and updating of these resources.
-   It can create, update, and delete entire stacks of resources.
-   Change sets enable previewing proposed changes before execution.
-   [[id:5cb84cfd-1cc2-4470-bfae-7c7cf758a998][Drift detection]] helps identify manual changes made outside of CloudFormation.

/Connections/

CloudFormation serves as a central mechanism (the /tool/) to manage infrastructure (the /resources/) in the AWS ecosystem (the /platform/). The /templates/ are the specification of the desired state, and CloudFormation is the engine that translates this specification into actual resources. /Change sets/ and /drift detection/ are mechanisms for managing and verifying the desired state against the actual state.

/Clarifying Questions/

-   What specific type of infrastructure management are you interested in understanding (e.g., deployment, configuration management, testing)?
-   What is your current level of familiarity with AWS and IaC concepts?

/Research Pathways/

-   How does CloudFormation compare to other AWS IaC services like CDK or SAM?
-   What are the best practices for structuring large CloudFormation templates and stacks?
-   How can CloudFormation be integrated into CI/CD pipelines for automated infrastructure provisioning?
-   What are the security considerations when using CloudFormation and how can they be mitigated?
