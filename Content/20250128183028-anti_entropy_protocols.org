#+title: Anti-Entropy Protocols
#+filetags: :cs:

* Overview

- *Definition*:
  - Anti-entropy protocols are methods used in [[id:a3d0278d-d7b7-47d8-956d-838b79396da7][distributed]] systems to ensure data [[id:e833eafc-e622-4631-a1ee-f9c679a4d71d][consistency]] across nodes.

- *Purpose*:
  - They help reconcile differences between [[id:8cd19397-b5e5-40b6-a172-456c34985a11][replicas]], particularly in systems where data may diverge due to concurrent writes or network failures.

- *Mechanisms*:
  - These protocols typically involve periodic checks of data states across nodes, followed by synchronization to resolve discrepancies.

- *Types*:
  - *Push-based*: One node sends its data state to others.
  - *Pull-based*: Nodes request updates from one another.
  - *Hybrid*: Combines both push and pull mechanisms.

- *Application*:
  - Commonly used in distributed databases (e.g., [[id:4f6c9fa4-ab8c-48da-a412-27a5a5867a21][Dynamo]], [[id:20240519T221905.005300][Cassandra]]) and [[id:20240519T201442.376294][peer-to-peer]] networks.

- *Challenges*:
  - [[id:aa3f4461-08f4-4a3d-ae4b-5704d1f3dd23][Latency]]: Ensuring prompt updates can be difficult in large networks.
  - [[id:e8f3c721-0dba-4dc7-803f-263e88a47596][Network Partitioning]]: Handling situations where network splits can lead to divergent state.
  - Performance: Balancing consistency checks without overloading the system.
