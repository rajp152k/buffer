* Overview
** *Definition*:
  - Data Mesh is a [[id:3c0c2077-b24a-4f6b-b93f-f06c08f7b3e9][decentralized]] approach to [[id:ee0b0178-82f7-4fd2-af51-f6378f251c9e][data architecture]] and organizational design.
  - It treats data as a product, promoting data ownership by domain teams rather than [[id:5c59fbd4-1f9a-4438-a10e-bbfb4991b859][centralizing]] data management.

** *Core Principles*:
  1. *Domain-Oriented Decentralization*:
     - Decomposes data architecture based on business domains or capabilities.
     - Empowers domain teams to take ownership of data quality, governance, and accessibility.
  2. *Data as a Product*:
     - Treats data assets with the same rigor and standards as customer-facing products.
     - Incorporates practices of product thinking, including user-centric design and iterative improvements.
  3. *Self-Serve Data Infrastructure*:
     - Facilitates autonomous data engineering by providing reusable infrastructure and tools.
     - Focuses on reducing friction for domain teams to produce and consume data streams.
  4. *Federated Computational Governance*:
     - Implements a governance model that balances standardization with flexibility.
     - Encourages shared accountability and compliance within a federated structure.

** *Implementation Strategies*:
  - Organizational restructuring to support domain-oriented teams with end-to-end autonomous capabilities.
  - Adoption of cloud-native data platforms to enable scalable self-service capabilities.
  - Integration of [[id:6beb22b6-8f0e-4e9f-b01e-679df272976a][agile]] and [[id:58ea31e4-95ae-4c25-b475-c8686fe23817][DevOps]] practices to streamline data product development and operations.
  - Emphasis on collaboration between data producers and consumers through cross-functional teams.

** *Implications and Benefits*:
  - Improved agility and responsiveness to business needs by empowering domain experts.
  - Enhanced data quality and relevance through ownership and accountability at the domain level.
  - Reduction in bottlenecks and silos typically associated with centralized data management.
  - Better alignment between data initiatives and business priorities.
