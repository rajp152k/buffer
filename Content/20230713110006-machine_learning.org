This node captures misc information regarding the large root that ML is.
I plan on accumulating and assimilating all that I learn from various domains in a uniform manner here. It'll be notebooks from completed [[id:f275e17f-307e-4e2b-a67b-6511774d0a3d][kaggle]] competitions, blogs, papers, courses, anything that's worth goes in. I don't plan on incorporating complete book walkthroughs in here - I'll reference them and won't be mapping what I read verbatim. [[id:9539ffd2-433b-4cac-babc-0d45990a4642][Wikipedia]] is a good quick reference so will be referencing that too rather than typing what's within convenient reach.
* Misc nodes
** Production
*** The Drive Train Approach
 - first encountered in [[id:c6e31908-5622-4e17-9ccd-6b4e71f53ff1][DL for Coders : fastai + pytorch]]
 - https://www.oreilly.com/radar/drivetrain-approach-data-products/
** No Free Lunch
 - no model is better at all problems than all other models
** [[id:51c4a1c3-9289-4f09-bb95-1585b750f328][Occam's Razor]]
 - on why traditional machine learning methods are still relevant with [[id:20230713T110040.814546][Deep Learning]] on the rise.
** [[id:398d134d-6193-409a-b3b5-9e7c7de86ce7][Interpretable ML]]
 - ML models are generally a black box that are inexplicable representations of the data they are trained on.
 - understanding how a model favors certain outputs for a set of input features is a domain in itself.
** [[id:67812842-bd33-4927-a693-fdf02721b019][Mixture of Expert]]
** Universal Approximation Theorem
 - any mathematical function can be modelled with the desired level of accuracy given the right architecture and enough training
 - is a foundational theorem responsible for [[id:20230713T110040.814546][Deep Learning]]'s rise
** [[id:abe10062-2d23-47ce-8e5c-4cc4789605d2][Collaborative Filtering]]
* Foundational Papers
A series oriented towards summarizing some important foundational reads in the machine learning community. I'll be formally writing about the same on [[id:a452786b-9ccc-4883-885b-d501be95e510][Bits2Nats]] once I incorporate them into the zettelkasten here. Do note that these are papers and not textbooks - won't be summarizing textbooks - if that wasn't obvious.
* Foundational Texts
A collection of foundational textbooks I'd like to read and incorporate into the notes here slowly over a long duration of time. Reading them all at once might not be the best strategy - Although I'm imagining now, the burnout from too much technical reads packed close together is quite real.
Do note that I'm collating the foundational texts of [[id:20230713T110040.814546][Deep Learning]] and [[id:9cac188e-8229-4c7a-9cb4-eeb5e81f8010][Reinforcement Learning]] here as well.
