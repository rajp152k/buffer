 - alright, I work in neovim + tmux and I write and research in [[id:20230712T224009.631876][Emacs]]
 - feels like a healthy middle ground between speed and extensibility.
 - checkout the [[id:fdbc2e71-ec1f-40b4-82c3-290634126675][init.vim+lua]]
 - well, I've got a functional polyglot oriented setup ready with Mason and its fast
 - Now all my writing, organization and Lisp happens in emacs
   - all the code in nvim
   - doesn't feel that odd : just like speaking two languages with a common linguistic root (evil..).
   - the mindset that I'm in when using the two is quite different
