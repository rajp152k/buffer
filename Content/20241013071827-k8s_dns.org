* Overview
** [[id:c2072565-787a-4cea-9894-60fad254f61d][Kubernetes]] (K8S) DNS Overview
  - Kubernetes includes a built-in [[id:c1875db1-be4d-43fe-9c88-bf5fc7a95df3][DNS]] server that correlates with the services within the cluster.
  - When a new service is created, the DNS server is notified and can manage DNS records accordingly.
  - DNS names follow the format =<service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local=.
  - The DNS server helps with service discovery, allowing Kubernetes services to communicate seamlessly.
  - [[id:d3f2c59a-602d-4a88-8828-82797f25fbd3][CoreDNS]] is the default DNS solution from version 1.13 onwards, replacing kube-dns.

** Functional Components of K8S DNS
  - Service Discovery: Simplifies the process of finding and connecting with services by names rather than IPs.
  - Pod DNS Resolution: Each pod can query the DNS system, facilitating interaction with other services.
  - ClusterDNS: Configures kubelets to communicate with the DNS server for name resolutions.
  - CoreDNS Configuration: Provides flexibility and supports various plugins for handling DNS queries efficiently.
