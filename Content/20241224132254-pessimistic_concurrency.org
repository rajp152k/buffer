* Overview

*** Pessimistic Concurrency: Overview

- *Definition*: Pessimistic concurrency control is a type of database management approach where transactions are assumed to conflict with each other, leading to increased [[id:efab98ca-07db-4413-ac17-5950c2c999ad][locking mechanisms]] to maintain data integrity.

- *Locking Mechanism*:
  - *Exclusive Locks*: Prevent other transactions from accessing data until the lock is released.
  - *Shared Locks*: Allow multiple transactions to read data simultaneously but prevent updates.

- *Advantages*:
  - Ensures data consistency and integrity by preventing concurrent access issues.
  - Reduces the likelihood of lost updates and dirty reads.

- *Disadvantages*:
  - Can lead to increased waiting times and decreased system performance due to locks.
  - Can result in deadlocks where two or more transactions hold locks that each other needs to proceed.

- *Use Cases*:
  - Critical systems where data integrity is paramount (e.g., financial applications).
  - Environments with high conflict among transactions.

*** Connections between Entities

- *Locking Mechanism & Advantages*: The use of exclusive and shared locks directly correlates to the advantage of data [[id:20240519T152842.050227][consistency]], as it minimizes the risk of conflicting transactions.

- *Use Cases & Disadvantages*: Certain environments may prioritize data integrity at the cost of performance, making pessimistic concurrency suitable for specific applications but problematic in highly concurrent environments.
