** Tenets
    - Modularity: Divide programs into distinct, reusable modules that can be independently developed and maintained.

    - Simplicity: Prioritize clarity and conciseness in code design to enhance both readability and maintainability.

    - Compatibility: Ensure software compatibility across a range of hardware and operating system platforms for seamless deployment and execution.

    - Extensibility: Design programs to seamlessly integrate with future enhancements and extensions, facilitating adaptability to changing requirements and evolving technologies.

*** Pragmatics

    - Single Responsibility Principle: Assign each program a unique and well-defined purpose, enabling efficient and focused execution.

    - Pipes and Filters: Connect programs through pipelines to form complex workflows, allowing data to flow seamlessly through multiple processing stages.

    - Abstraction and Encapsulation: Treat all data as a stream of characters, concealing implementation details and providing a consistent interface for data manipulation.
