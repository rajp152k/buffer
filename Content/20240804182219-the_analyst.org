I've been analysing pragmatic archteypes lately (started [[id:20240420T190107.545784][The Reader]]  and the [[id:20240420T190123.489781][The Writer]]) and find them to be generically useful across a span of domains.

Rather than thinking of a particular group of ideas that could be useful in a situation, I find invoking upon an evolving archetype that practices those ideas to be more suited to my liking.
