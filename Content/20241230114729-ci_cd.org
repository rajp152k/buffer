* Overview

- *CI (Continuous Integration):*
  - Automated process where code changes are frequently integrated into a shared repository.
  - Each integration is verified by automated builds and [[id:17d78466-2fcc-47aa-af20-9b74d94c96bb][tests]].
  - Aims to detect errors quickly, enhance software quality, and reduce the time it takes to release software.

- *CD (Continuous Delivery/Continuous Deployment):*
  - Continuous Delivery refers to the practice of keeping code in a deployable state.
    - Code changes automatically prepared for a release to production.
    - Manual approval required for production deployment.
  - Continuous Deployment allows for automatic deployment of every change that passes automated tests to production.
  - Aims to enable frequent updates and quick delivery of new features to end-users.

- *Key Components:*
  - [[id:038e3720-0307-41d8-bcb1-e77b75a161df][Version Control Systems]] (e.g., Git)
