* Abstract

Generic Languages miss out on more frequent usages of a particular kind of problem domain.

The Verbs and Nouns of a domain specific language are closely related to objects and behaviours in the concerned problem domain.

In the longer run, the overhead of designing and adapting a specialized language to the domain is more than compensated by the efficiency gains due to the underlying complexity being abstracted away.

It simplifies the process of extending an application, relevant to the domain under discussion.
