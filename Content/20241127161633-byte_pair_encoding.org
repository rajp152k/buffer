#+title: Byte Pair Encoding

* Overview
- *Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)*:
  - A form of data [[id:2a09af3c-8c56-4874-b18b-b728b0d655c7][compression]] technique originally developed for [[id:9e07b6d4-aa6a-4584-bb4e-6f1285be34c3][text]].
  - Encodes a sequence of bytes and reduces redundancy by replacing the most frequently occurring pairs of bytes wi
th a single unused byte or symbol.
  - Commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) to preprocess text data, especially for subword tokenization.

- *Process*:
  - Count all the pairs of contiguous symbols in the data.
  - Identify the most frequent pair and replace all occurrences of that pair with a new symbol.
  - Repeat the process for a predefined number of iterations or until a certain compression ratio is achieved.

- *Applications*:
  - Utilized in various [[id:20230713T150554.400026][NLP]] models, including [[id:4f9006cf-6e6f-4019-bb8d-e7d5d85e191e][transformers]] (like [[id:214ec3f0-8aa3-426c-82fa-57886b5c0f39][GPT]]) for efficiently handling large vocabularies by producing subword units.
  - Reduces out-of-vocabulary words by breaking rare words into smaller, common subword units.

- *Advantages*:
  - Efficient handling of large datasets with diverse vocabularies.
  - Balances between fully character-based and word-based encoding, improving efficiency and performance.

- *Limitations*:
  - May lead to the creation of subword units that are not meaningful in isolation.
  - Requires careful tuning of the number of merges to avoid overfitting to the training data.

*** Connections

- BPE is significant within the broader context of data compression techniques and NLP preprocessing.
- Its effectiveness relates to various algorithms in the field of machine learning that handle linguistic data, including tokenization strategies in transformer architectures.
- BPE can also be compared with other encoding methods such as WordPiece and SentencePiece, which serve similar purposes but differ in their algorithms and implementations.
