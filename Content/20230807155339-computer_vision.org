* Abstract
 - So far, I'm aware of the use of [[id:269b1dfd-6854-42e7-9c8d-82cda0c8f329][Connectionism]] in here but not quite sure how one would go about applying [[id:20230713T113547.742751][Symbolic AI]] in here.
* Specifics
** [[id:8ec98ed1-317f-494d-8f03-acf820bde2a4][Face Processing]]
* Tools
 - [[id:6bc26d93-f08d-4b9f-9df1-443e7faece42][OpenCV]] : will be using this to build a starting groud for all things opencv.
   - will be exploring with python but the functions are exposed with similar semantics in other languages so that shouldn't too big of a deal
   - this activity, in the context of this dump, will do for CV, what Spacy did for NLP
