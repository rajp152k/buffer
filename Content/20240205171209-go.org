- finished "Let's Go"
- will do "Let's Go Further" sometime down the lane
- getting into "Cloud Native Go" now though
- will soon start with open source contribs in the CNCF landscape
- The concurrency model of golang : [[id:0458f827-5634-41e0-b261-dfc5cb2d2389][CSP-Concurrency]]
- choosing golang as my principal language for the close future
- is the lingua-cloud-native and do see myself personally benefitting moving away from the lisp romantic that I am for some time and building practical stuff.
- as usual, I begin with verifying org babel works

  #+begin_src go :exports both
package main

import "fmt"

func main(){
	fmt.Println(`Verifying Org-Babel works for golang
exporting both input and output as I usually do with all source that I write`)
}
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Verifying Org-Babel works for golang
  : exporting both input and output as I usually do with all source that I write

- works, and I'm ready to go..
