#+title: The Read-Act-Write Protocol
#+filetags: :meta:protocol:

I don't know a lot about a lot.
I wish to know a lot about a lot.

This framework has worked for me, when it comes to gaining competency in a domain:
 - research sweeps i.e. Read
 - conduct informed expriments i.e. Act
 - maintain records and consolidate i.e. Write
 - iterate until satisfaction

I do apply this only to the domains that I'm seriously considering to be worth the time. In any other case, I roam around freely based on the whims of my whims. So if you've been directed to this node from a node-set somewhere, the implication is that I'm investing seriously into the study of that node-set and the content there-in is more reliable than a non-RAW node set.
