#+title: Cache Control Headers
#+filetags: :web:cs:

* Overview

- *Definition*: Cache control headers are HTTP headers used to define caching policies for web browsers and intermediary caches.

- *Purpose*:
  - Optimize loading times by determining how long resources are cached.
  - Ensure that users see the most recent version of a resource.

- *Common Cache Control Directives*:
  - =no-cache=: Forces caches to submit a request to the origin server for validation before releasing a cached copy.
  - =no-store=: Prevents caching of the resource entirely.
  - =max-age=: Specifies the maximum amount of time a resource is considered fresh, in seconds.
  - =public=: Indicates that the response may be cached by any cache.
  - =private=: Indicates that the response is intended for a single user and should not be stored by shared caches.

- *Browser Behavior*:
  - When a browser receives these headers, it determines how to cache or fetch resource updates, impacting user experience.

- *Impact on Performance*:
  - Correctly configured caching can significantly reduce server load and latency for returning users.

*Connections between Entities*:
- Cache control headers interact with web applications, influencing how content is delivered and experienced by end users.
- They are particularly significant in conjunction with other web optimization strategies, such as [[id:20240101T082700.953774][Content Delivery Networks]] (CDNs) and application-layer caching.
