* Overview

- *Definition of Time Complexity*: A computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm as a function of the length of the input.

- *Big O Notation*: Provides an upper bound on the time complexity, allowing for worst-case scenario analysis. Common notations include:
  - O(1): Constant time
  - O(log n): Logarithmic time
  - O(n): Linear time
  - O(n log n): Linearithmic time
  - O(n^2): Quadratic time
  - O(2^n): Exponential time

- [[id:b9d4742e-ffa3-465a-aba1-2133db03abd3][Complexity Classes]]:
  - P: Problems that can be solved in polynomial time.
  - NP: Problems for which solutions can be verified in polynomial time.
  - NP-complete: Hardest problems in NP, which if solved in polynomial time would imply P = NP.


*** Questions for Further Clarification:
- What specific algorithm or data structure are you focusing on in the context of time complexity?
- Are there particular properties of time complexity (e.g., average case vs. worst case) you wish to explore further?

*** Pathways for Further Research:
- How do different data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees) impact time complexity?
- In what scenarios do average case complexities differ significantly from worst-case analyses?
- What are the implications of time complexity in real-time systems versus batch processing systems?
