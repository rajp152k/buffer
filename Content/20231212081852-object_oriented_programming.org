 - Was reading practical common lisp some time ago and the chapter on OOP referenced to the idea of OOP being implemented in different ways in different programming languages.
 - caching directions to explore this idea with depth later on:
   - see implementation architecture of OOP in:
     1. Simula (origins)
     2. Python/Java (Pure)
     3. JavaScript (Prototypical)
     4. Common Lisp (CLOS)
     5. C++ (I don't really know the exact details: read more)
