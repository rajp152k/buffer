*** Intro

- techno-talkthrough
  - larger, overarching concept
  - rapid practical examples

- This video:

  - idea is to build the conceptual idea buff stackability in you tools

  - the collaborative interop is greater  than the individual worths of these tools

*** Buff Stacking Emacs

   - the extensibility allows the community to be flexible and build all sorts of things

   - can fit your needs (whatever they are)

   - sensible defaults with doom emacs can get you started quickly

   - to the pragmatics right away

   - the toolsets stack on each other due to powerful & uniform underlying representation

   - lisp machine: I'm actively exploring this more and will soon publish fully-baked content

*** Pragmatics

 - version control anything: magit
   - faster porcelain than the cli
   - dedicated video coming in soon

 - LLM interface as a text buffer

 - eww -> firefox

 - lsp-mode (+ dap + treesitter)
   - polyglotic programming ++
   - generic programming hooks (M-x compile, etc)

 - org -> blogs, todos, capture buffers, notes, literate programming, babel
   - dedicated video coming soon

 - context-aware snippets
   - python
   - go
   - markups, org, markdown

 - dired, projectile, buffer, proc, file management
   - can also use external proc management if you prefer that
   - I prefer btop as a decent monitor of all (metrics) at once
     - temp, other misc stuff
     - compute(CPUUtils, mem), storage(IOPs), networks(B/s)
     - proc management
   - I like it this way: wouldn't want monitoring emacs from emacs

 - I can't even claim to be an efficient emacs user yet
   - don't use elisp as much yet (other than configs), working actively on that front

*** Emacs as your OS

   - Emacs as your OS (lucky to spend 90% of my day in emacs)

     - for the modal humans our there : emacs is my normal mode now

     - can further minimize context switching by altering your workflows into more keyboard oriented modalities
       - firefox + vimium
       - i3wm if you're Xorg, I'm on wayland so sway

*** What Next?

 - I also blog : check out the bitmage.com
   - if you're into text (site.xml RSS at the bottom left)

 - a lot of emacs stuff coming in your way

 - also will get into a lot of CLI LINUX/UNIX/GNU in a phase later on

 - thanks for tuning in, this was the bitmage

** 0x21BD
 - studying how org-lists work : might try to extend the features with something useful of my own
** 0x21B0
 - will be altering the work space and the required mindset that allows me to run emacs as a client with an ever-running daemon
** 0x2178
 - I already use vim bindings in emacs but I do miss the command line
 - have decided to go minimal for my work and retain emacs for personal projects and writing
 - reading up on the unix philosophy and aiming to become a true shell ninja.
 - knowing about Unix operating system does excite me and do hope to learn a lot more
 - I'll definitely never give up emacs but a basic awareness of the operating system with the utilities of a CLI do encourage me to get good at both ecosystems
 - starting a similar [[id:8bc9d1c6-da56-4db9-a904-8f052e6836cb][Vim]] stream to log all my works, I'll be keeping the vimrc simple this time and not be using a lot of external plugins but rely on the vanilla features of vim
 - already excited about getting back to a dark green terminal screen..
** 0x2127
 - youtube video on navigating the text editing landscape
   - on why one should not settle even in 2023
 - starting with the skills necessary to efficiently edit text
   - touch typing -> efficient navigation (vim) -> playing with the nuts and bolts (emacs)
     - why not VS code?
** 0x211F
 - thinking of writing and emacs extension
   - visualizing my knowledge graph in an interactive manner
   - existing extensions do exist but it would be a good experience building it from scratch
   - will be proceeding formally and take it up as a proper initiative
** 0x211E
Started using smudge (spotify on emacs) : more time in emacs...
Thinking of summarizing my init.el in a blog : been around 2-3 years since I last did that 
** 0x2118
The single greatest tool choice I've ever made in terms of editing efficiently (right along side vim : I use Evil GccEmacs 28 as of now)
