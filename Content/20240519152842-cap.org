* Basics

[[id:a3d0278d-d7b7-47d8-956d-838b79396da7][Distributed]] Systems: Applies to systems that run on multiple computers connected over a [[id:a4e712e1-a233-4173-91fa-4e145bd68769][network]].

* The Tradeoff
You can only guarantee two out of three properties:

 - Consistency (C): Everyone sees the same data at the same time.

 - Availability (A): The system is always up and running, even with some failures.

 - Partition Tolerance (P): The system keeps working even if network problems split it into parts.

Network Problems are unavoidable, so partition tolerance is a must.
   
* The Choice
Have to choose between consistency and availability when network problems happen:
 - CP Systems: Prioritize consistency, may become unavailable during problems.
 - AP Systems: Prioritize availability, may show outdated data during problems.
