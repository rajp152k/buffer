* Abstract
An ordered collection of [[id:7517a8cb-763d-40fd-8355-ad7ff8aca8e8][Scalars]] : the ordered nature of this collection attributes the direction to vectors.

The size of this collection is the dimension of the vector : a vector generalizes into a [[id:e894d26e-ef45-4225-8478-380164f75883][Tensor]].

Accessing a particular element of a tensor is termed as indexing into it.

* Operations
 - vector-vector addition
 - scalar-vector multiplication
 - dot product
 - cross product
 - matrix vector multiplication
   - this is an oriented collection of dot-products

 - a more detailed expansion on the relevant math for vectors (and matrices and tensors) will be populated in here from the paper : [[https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/][The Matrix Calculus you need for Deep Learning]]
