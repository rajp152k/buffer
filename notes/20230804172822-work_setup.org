A stream logging update in my work setup :- hardware, software and any other auxiliaries.

* 0x212E

 - have shifted to using gray-scale filters for all my screens (all monitors, phone and the kindle(by default))
 - feels a little odd initially but less stuff catches my eye, when ,say.., scrolling feeds or just browsing the web.
 - makes the internet to be a much more linear experience :- have disabled images by default for eww and only activate them when some text refers to the existence of an infographic.
 - have been reading a lot lately : reading speed getting back to what it was slowly.
 - regularly learning a lot about emacs -> the setup is getting more efficient day by day without much effort..
 - taking notes with org-roam is a habit now and don't need to break the flow while studying/reading/exploring a topic.
