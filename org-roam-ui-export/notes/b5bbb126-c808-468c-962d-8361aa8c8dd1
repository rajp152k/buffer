:END:
1. Obtain datum, label pairs that can be used for learning.
2. split the dataset into train, validation (optional testing) parts and decide on the [[id:bd383ba2-37e9-412f-b245-919fa47831bc][evaluation metrics]] that will be employed
3. pre-process the splits accordingly and proceed with alternating training/validation phase. Degrees of freedom that can be explored
   - improving feature engineering 
   - tuning the model hyperparameters
4. test and benchmark the model on the test set using the evaluation metric.
5. deployment : on new data points with unknown categories
