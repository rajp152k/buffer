A practical and extremely useful manifestation of a [[id:a4e712e1-a233-4173-91fa-4e145bd68769][Computer Network]].
Building on the internet will be explored under the subgraph around [[id:0a4948e7-6963-4f00-8e6b-4c9ea1291a3f][Web Dev]].

This node covers the what more than the whys and the hows.

Communication is what the internet was made for, [[id:d62399b2-10b5-4d6c-94ed-42daefd459fe][E-mail]] is another set of tooling and infrastructure that is worth studying for the pedagogical value of such an exercise : this allows to read up on [[id:a02542b4-23d5-4fa8-9469-45edc4dcee69][SMTP]]  as a useful instance of the application layer protocol (An even more ubiquitous practical instance would be [[id:a452b284-9ed0-4aed-a0d2-9bdb303a459c][HTTP]]).
