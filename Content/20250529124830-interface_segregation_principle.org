#+title: Interface Segregation Principle
#+filetags: :swarch:swe:


* Outline

** Definition : Single Responsibility, Client-Specific Interfaces
*** Dependency Inversion, Interface Segregation, High Cohesion
** Problem : Fat Interfaces, Fragile Base Class Problem
*** Tight Coupling, Fragility, Rigidity, Testability Issues
** Solution : Segregate Interfaces, Client-Specific Abstractions
*** Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion, Reduced Coupling
** Benefits : Improved Maintainability, Scalability, Testability
*** Loose Coupling, High Cohesion, Easier Refactoring
** Real-World Applications : Modular Design, [[id:54978664-78a5-4c2c-ae33-c4e6a14d6bb0][Microservices]] Architecture
*** Service-Oriented Architecture, [[id:a33dc160-71a2-484c-b1a8-8a74ffabba11][Domain-Driven Design]], Clean Architecture
