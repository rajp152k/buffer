#+title: Input Multiplexer
#+filetags: :electronics:programming:project:

 - an input device multiplexer that allows one to control multiple computers from the same input device.
 - might consider writing a device driver in a USB drive that might need an intermediate device that conditionally directs (i.e. multiplexes) input from a device based on the device mode chosen by the user.
