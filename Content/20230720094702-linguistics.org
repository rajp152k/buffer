* 0x211F

I do plan on learning several languages. I dabbled a bit in latin and sanskrit before I got lazy enough to drop it all and get into [[id:20230712T223044.319985][lisp]].

These set of nodes are meant to document similarities, differences and specifics of languages that I'm interested in

* Proficiency levels
rated as self-assigned 3-tuple : reading, writing, speech : from 0 to 10
 - English: (8,7,7)
 - Hindi: (3,2,6)
 - Marathi: (3,2,5)
 - French: (3,3,3)


 
* Watch List

 - Latin
   - to dive into the latinate roots of english
 - German
   - to dive into the germanic roots of english and communication
 - Mini
   - an interesting initiative : https://minilanguage.com/
   - could be a good toy-lang to dive into linguistics formally and not just be a dilettant.
