Helps tap into the reliable intellectual storage that the written word is.

* Personal Approach
I would consider myself to be a sporadic reader. Anytime I'm infatuated by a topic, I might speed read  a couple of articles and allocate a few bed-time books to put me to sleep. I also might just drop the book as quickly as I picked it up (or defer it).

Prefer E-books, for they allow me to efficiently carry around my currently active reads and are discrete. I pull out my phone and start swiping, you don't know if I'm reading or scrolling.
