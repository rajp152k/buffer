This is the Pseudo Node. There are several concepts that aren't that mentally tangible and we don't really experience them as one would slice of pizza or a slap on the face. Now the act of imagining these would fall under the pseudo node.

These aren't veriable due to their inherent nature of being whipped up from thin-air.

I collect all the abstract Pseudos here to see if I can find meaningful patterns
