* Detailed Elaboration

- *Definition*: Heapsort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm utilizing a [[id:5ed05b89-71e5-423c-b51c-dc53133c3e91][binary heap]] data structure. It is an efficient way to sort a collection of items.

- *Complexity*:
  - Time Complexity:
    - Worst-case: O(n log n)
    - Average-case: O(n log n)
    - Best-case: O(n log n)
  - Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting)

- *Process*:
  1. *Heap Construction*: Transform the list into a max-heap (or min-heap).
  2. *Sorting*:
     - Remove the maximum (or minimum) element from the heap, placing it in the sorted output.
     - Re-establish the heap property (heapify).
     - Repeat until the heap is empty.

- *Stability*: Heapsort is **not a stable sorting** algorithm because it can change the relative order of equal elements.

- *Use Cases*:
  - Best suited for situations where memory space is limited.
  - Effective for large datasets and when the complete data is not available at once.
