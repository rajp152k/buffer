AKA Textual feature representation

* Abstract 

 - not as straightforward as representing images, videos, speech
 - there is a malleable synthetic component to representation
   - gives rise to several degrees of freedom/choices in terms of how one chooses represent samples
 - an explicitly observable discrete (symbolic) component to the structure written language and maps to a vector space may not be that intuitive to the beginner at the get

** Characteristics of a good representation?

For any generic nlp task, processing a data point involves:
 - breaking the data point into its atomic units: retrieving their independent semantics
 - understanding their syntactics (grammar)
 - understading the context
 - finally, inferring the semantics of the data point as a whole from the above.

A good representation would intuitively facilitate the above operations.
