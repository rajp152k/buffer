 - Delving into the idea of Epistemological [[id:74cd7bc4-ea48-4c5e-a946-ea4125a6b618][Cartography]].
 - Cartography usually refers mapping landscapes and terrains physically. I find the idea of mapping the abstract knowledge landscape.
 - might allow me to do some interesting things
   - abstractly map journeys between domains
   - define closeness and interrelatedness between domains
 - it might just have to be a math in itself
 - the physical world we experience is 4 dimensional (time + location): but I can explicitly see that I'll need to work in an indefinite number of abstract dimensions when working with an epistemological landscape.
 - I think the idea is mature enough to create it's own node : see [[id:e702ab85-cc45-480b-955b-0ef620690b52][Epistemological Cartography]]

 - an important aspect of maintaining a malleable context for multiple domains is how you interact with your knowledge systems and how you consume information around you.

 - I index this personally as the philosophical theory of knowledge (which is vague).
 - Diving deeper so that I can start to formalize this via some representation ([[id:6efc5118-aa6d-43f7-bd46-5f0460819813][NIL]]) in my works.
