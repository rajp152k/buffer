#+title: Monkey Patching
#+filetags: :meta:cs:

* Overview

- *Definition*:
  - Monkey patching is a programming practice that involves modifying a class or module at runtime, allowing for alterations in behavior without altering the original source code.

- *Use Cases*:
  - Debugging: Temporarily override methods to print logs or alter behavior for testing.
  - Feature Enhancement: Add new functionalities to existing classes or libraries without explicit modification.
  - Fixing Bugs: Provide immediate fixes for bugs within libraries where source access may be limited.

- *Languages Commonly Used In*:
  - Python, Ruby, JavaScript, and other dynamic languages that support runtime code modification.

- *Implications*:
  - Pros:
    - Flexibility: Allows developers to adapt code quickly.
    - Fast Implementation: Quick fixes or enhancements can be applied without the need for full redeployment.
  - Cons:
    - Maintenance Challenge: Makes tracking changes and debugging more complex.
    - Risk of Compatibility Issues: Changes may cause conflicts when updating underlying libraries or frameworks.
    - voilation of the "closed" in open/closed principle of [[id:3348ef4f-dba9-43ac-9d3c-ba44e14c7478][SOLID Principles]]
