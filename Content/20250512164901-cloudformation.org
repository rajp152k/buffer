* Overview
- CloudFormation is an [[id:52c69951-3bcb-4aa8-9529-f18af61d46ff][Infrastructure as Code]] (IaC) service offered by AWS.
- It allows users to define AWS resources using templates.
- Templates are written in either [[id:7cd81a80-dbc4-4c6e-860a-f05b14798e68][YAML]] or [[id:48581776-0ba5-4d88-ad38-25c0cb90595f][JSON]].
- CloudFormation manages the provisioning and updating of these resources.
- It can create, update, and delete entire stacks of resources.
- Change sets enable previewing proposed changes before execution.
- [[id:5cb84cfd-1cc2-4470-bfae-7c7cf758a998][Drift detection]] helps identify manual changes made outside of CloudFormation.
