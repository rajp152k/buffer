* Overview

- *Definition*: Mathematical induction is a proof technique used to establish the truth of an infinite number of statements, typically involving integers.

- *Two Main Components*:
  - *Base Case*: Show that the statement holds for the initial value (usually n=1).
  - *Inductive Step*: Assume the statement is true for some arbitrary integer k (inductive hypothesis) and then prove it must also be true for k+1.

- *Structure of Induction*:
  1. *Base Case* (n=1): Verify the assertion is correct for the first integer.
  2. *Inductive Hypothesis*: Assume the assertion holds for n=k.
  3. *Inductive Step*: Prove the assertion holds for n=k+1 using the inductive hypothesis.
