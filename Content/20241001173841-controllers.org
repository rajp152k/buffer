* Overview
- *Controllers*: Automated systems managing the state of Kubernetes clusters.
- Essential for maintaining Kubernetes operations.
- Automates the repetitive and complex tasks.
- Key to achieving scalable and reliable container orchestration.
- see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/
** Core Functionality
- *State Reconciliation*: Compare current state to desired state.
- *Actions*:
  - Deploy
  - Mount volumes
  - Manage scaling
  - Handle failures
** Mechanism
- *Control Loop*: Continuously monitors and updates cluster state.
- *Work Queue*: Stores observations/changes for processing.
- *Reconcile Loop*: Processes items from Work Queue to align with desired state.

** Epistemological Correlations
- *[[id:925e2fbb-afb7-4857-853d-899bb9e2d8d1][Control Theory]]*: Similar to control systems in engineering.
- *[[id:a17d6ca7-c065-434e-8730-10871a9b3652][Homeostasis]] in Biology*: Maintains stable internal environment despite external changes.
