* Overview

- The scheduling component in Kubernetes is a core responsibility of the control plane.
- Assign pods to nodes ensuring optimal resource allocation and management.

* Primary Functionalities
** Resource Optimization
- Considers CPU, memory requests, and constraints.
** Affinity/Anti-affinity Rules
- Enables pod co-location or separation.
** Taints and Tolerations
- Ensures nodes can repel certain pods unless explicitly tolerated.
** NodeSelector and NodeAffinity
- Limits nodes that can host particular pods.
** Priorities and Preemption
- Ensures urgent pods get priority using preemption.
** Scheduler Algorithms:
    - Priority Functions: Rank nodes based on set criteria.
    - Predicate Functions: Determines if a pod can run on a particular node.
** Custom Schedulers:
    - Allows for user-defined policies and scheduling strategies.
