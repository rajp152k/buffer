* Misc

 - without pulling up a dictionary, this pertains to something that isn't "real".
 - boundaries between plans, dreams, reality, delusions and the likes are discretized by the tag of hallucinations.
 - I think it has the potential to be an interesting exercise that can serve some purposes that I'm not yet aware of.
 - I am considering hallucinating more in this brain dump in a pseudo-sciency manner for the sake of exploration and hypothesizing without the fear of inaccuracies.
