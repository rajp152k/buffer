Rigorously testing and expanding the edges of a [[id:20230712T212419.175018][Domain]].

I conducted some professional research during my Uni-days but I didn't quite enjoy the concretized nature of thought that I had to stick to.

Given my [[id:20231111T232750.075460][polymathic]] inclinations, I plan on exploring the edges more like a vagabond than a military expansion - I find that to be more enjoyable and I'm not setting out with any expectations but, honestly, do expect to rediscover several pre-explored [[id:e702ab85-cc45-480b-955b-0ef620690b52][epistemological townships]] and maybe some day from the depths of the ocean to the edges of the Universe (via thought experiments (stretching the analogy a bit)).

Other than academic and industrial research, I believe humanity as a whole could benefit from [[https://thebitmage.com/post/solitude-society-originality/][individual exploration as well]].
