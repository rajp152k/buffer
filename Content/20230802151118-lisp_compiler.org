#+title: lisp compiler
#+filetags: :lisp:

 - compiles lisp forms into machine language
 - speed up of 10-100x than the REPL way
 - with reference to  [[id:b00834e3-eae6-474f-98ab-01c0533533e8][macro-expansion]], they shouldn't have side effects as they may be evaluated at different instances dependent on the implementations.

* Structuring a File
 - use defvar,defparameter,defconstant for global declarations to suppress warnings that the compiler may raise other wise -> preferably at the top of the file
 - any macro defs should precede their references in functions or other macros.
 - redefinitions raise warnings
 - refrain from redefining built-ins
