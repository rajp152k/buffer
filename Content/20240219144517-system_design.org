* Major Aspects
** [[id:56dbce77-b258-4fde-a6c7-f865e476c879][Scalability]]
- the ability of a system to continue to behave as expected in the face of significant upward or downward changes in demand.
** [[id:adaf5bfa-48f9-415b-893e-7398b10f383e][Loose Coupling]]
- the system property and design strategy in which a system's components have minimal knowledge of any other components.
- internal changes to one don't demand changes in the other
- web servers and web browsers for instance are loosely coupled given both have certain guarantees.
** Enablement
- Having a [[id:11d303f1-d337-4f51-b211-db435a9f2cd0][Protocol]] allows standardizing the input expectations and output assurances of a component.
- These may be addressed as [[id:11d303f1-d337-4f51-b211-db435a9f2cd0][Interfaces]] as well.
** [[id:b24fb743-99bb-4e1a-b4a4-3b81c9677360][Resilience]]
- see also [[id:20240519T162542.805560][fault tolerence]]
- the measure of how well a system withstands and recovers from errors and faults
** [[id:2cd51b23-f253-40e2-8c5d-6f2924ca484d][Manageability]]
 - the ease with which a system's behaviour can be modified to keep it secure, running smoothly, and compliant with changing requirements.
** [[id:3913909e-2b8d-465c-8303-5c634bd08f57][Observability]]
 - the measure of how well a system's internal states can be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs.
* Performance Improvement Strategies
** Multi [[id:cf890270-836b-4beb-841d-af3f8ba6e5f3][Data Center]] Setups
** [[id:e5d0b6eb-ea62-4339-a190-97f4cb4b5678][GeoDNS]]
** [[id:20240101T082700.953774][CDN]]
