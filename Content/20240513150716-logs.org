* Abstract
Logs track how the state of an entity changes over time i.e. tracking an actor's (usually multiple actors') actions in a temporally serialized manner.

With the [[id:710e11f8-780a-4aa5-84fc-c0ab9bb848c0][increasing volumes of data]], book keeping state with discipline can mean the difference between an untrackable source of failure and resurrecting the state for quicker recoveries after a failure
