  *   Causes: These can include [[id:27530782-c327-4b2d-b742-21783dfd8e01][monotony]], lack of [[id:0c27b7ae-e696-4912-98d8-60b1b9d9b32d][stimulation]], a perception of [[id:e10fbf23-84f7-4902-86a2-a641d1a88f87][meaninglessness]], or feeling constrained.
  *   Symptoms: These range from restlessness and irritability to difficulty concentrating and a sense of emptiness.
  *   Consequences: Prolonged boredom can lead to negative outcomes such as depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and risky behavior.
  *   Coping mechanisms: These include seeking novelty, setting goals, engaging in creative activities, or finding meaning in current activities.
  *   Neurological basis: Research suggests involvement of the prefrontal cortex and the dopamine system.
  *   Evolutionary perspective: Boredom may serve as a signal to seek new and more rewarding experiences, promoting exploration and learning.
  *   Existential perspective: Boredom can be seen as a confrontation with the lack of inherent meaning in life, prompting a search for personal meaning and purpose.
