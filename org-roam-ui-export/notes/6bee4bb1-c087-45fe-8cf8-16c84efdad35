A List of miscellaneous tasks that need a little time to be tended to properly and shouldn't require much effort

* Work setup
 - [ ] automate Eye-browse initial window config for 2 frames
   - call make-frame and corresponding tagged window creators in init.el
 - [ ] cache quick nodes somewhere in the index for quick reference (also so that I don't forget they exist)
 - [ ] create a now page for my blog that is separate from my about page : i like the idea :- inspiration - https://nownownow.com/about
