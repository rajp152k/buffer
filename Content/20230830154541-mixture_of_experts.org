* Overview

** *Mixture of Experts (MoE):*
  - An [[id:05507b9a-ab6b-45cb-92b4-d71b574c5b7b][ensemble]] technique generally used in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
  - Involves multiple "experts" models, each specialized in different parts of the input space or tasks.
  - A gating network is used to determine which expert should be used for a particular input.

** *Key Concepts:*
  - *Expert Models:* Specialized models that focus on specific areas of a problem or dataset.
  - *Gating Network:* A mechanism that selects the most appropriate expert or combination of experts for given input data.
  - *Ensemble Method:* Combines the outputs of different models to improve the performance over single models.

** *Benefits:*
  - Offers the potential for increased efficiency as each expert only processes relevant data, reducing computational load.
  - Can lead to better model performance by leveraging specialization.
  - Encourages increased model interpretability through modular design.

** *Challenges:*
  - Designing effective gating networks can be complex.
  - Balancing the expertise for different subspaces or tasks is non-trivial.
  - Overhead of managing and training multiple experts.

** *Applications:*
  - Any domain where tasks can be effectively decomposed or benefit from [[id:6fcb5324-7c6f-4b3d-8a1e-718ad7142825][specialization]].

** *In-Depth Connections:*

- The gating mechanism can draw parallels to [[id:ea67fa6d-6bc9-44fb-98a2-63bc9f95f8ea][attention mechanisms]] where certain "attention weights" dictate focus on parts of data.

- Shares similarities with [[id:b8f3591e-1d49-4a0d-9182-3c8e33a48450][modular neural networks]], which aim to handle complex tasks through specialized components.

- MoE is conceptually related to [[id:60121a6c-9dd8-4a17-8a87-15e8147ab228][divide-and-conquer]] strategies in computer science, where problems are broken into simpler sub-problems.
