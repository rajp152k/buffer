* Distributed File System

Hadoop is a widely-used framework for dealing with large data sets distributed across clusters of computers. Here's a concise breakdown:

- *Hadoop [[id:a3d0278d-d7b7-47d8-956d-838b79396da7][Distributed]] File System (HDFS):*
  - *Purpose:* Designed to store very large files across multiple machines within a cluster.
  - *Architecture:* Master-slave, consisting of a NameNode (master) and multiple DataNodes (slaves).
  - *Characteristics:*
    - *Fault Tolerance:* Automatically replicates data across multiple nodes.
    - *High Throughput:* Designed to write once and read many times, optimizing access times.
    - *Scalability:* Easily scalable by adding more nodes to the cluster.
  - *Components:*
    - *NameNode:* Manages metadata and namespace; it's a single point of failure in early versions.
    - *DataNode:* Stores actual data and performs operations as instructed by NameNode.
  - *Data Model:* Stores data in large blocks (default 128MB or larger), optimizing for large file storage operations.

*** Connections and Context:

- *Hadoop Ecosystem:*
  - *[[id:2cc32697-c4ce-41b8-987a-2a44a09f78c3][MapReduce]]:* Programming model for large-scale data processing in parallel.
  - *YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator):* Manages resources and job scheduling for Hadoop clusters.
  - *Other Components:* Often includes elements like [[id:62ba92d7-598d-4cc9-b2bd-8bc7bcab7123][Hive]], [[id:ebd4a55a-6d00-4c3f-9a8a-f806a3e5c2bc][Pig]], and [[id:99aafe54-241d-4683-ae2d-4152bb9801fc][HBase]] for data querying and management.

- *Comparison with Other Systems:*
  - *Vs. Traditional Relational Databases:* More suited to unstructured data and large-scale batch operations.
  - *Vs. Other File Systems:* Specifically designed for distributed, parallel processing, unlike traditional distributed filesystems.
