** 0x22F2
 - starting out with setting up a data lake
 - reading on the book : fundamentals of data engineering
 - will be populating a lot of relevant nodes that demand further exploration
 - all tagged as =:data:=
 - do have foundational data science experience; intrigued to explore how it scales out operationally.
 - will not be able to do and end to end over view of the whole field.
 - will be indexing into relevant nodes from the stream sub nodes instead.
