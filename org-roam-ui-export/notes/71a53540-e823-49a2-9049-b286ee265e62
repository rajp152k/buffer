*** Misc
 - identifying named entities in a document without explicitly given info for the same -> "where was Anakin Skywalker born?".
   - The algorithm has to figure out that Anakin is a fictitious character, and extract the name of the ficitious place where he was born (Tatooine).
 - entities can be names of persons, locations, organizations ... context specific strings like monetary figures, law numbers etc.
 - NER is also a major precursor to the tasks that follow in this buffer
*** Approaches
 - straight-forward way -> maintain a large collection of type-entity pairs -> termed as a gazetteer. The problem is reduced to that of a lookup : this is a good starting point if the collection is large.
   - basically turns into the maintenance of a data structure (search, insert, deletion etc..) and choosing a representation for specific cases (aliases, for instance)
 - The next step is rule-based NER -> operates by storing common patterns based on word tokens and part of speech tagging. see [[https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/ner.html][Named Entity Recognition | CoreNLP]] and [[id:68e44f89-7d87-4ac6-9c00-f6ba3c38257d][SpaCy]]'s [[https://spacy.io/api/entityruler/][EntityRuler · spaCy API Documentation]]
 - Practically, ML models are preferable over hard-coded intelligence.
   - a decision has to be made for each word for whether it is an entity (similar to a [[id:f8d2207f-86d3-4501-a7bc-393fb53c52c1][Text Classification]] problem for each word -> a sequence annotation/labelling problem -> context is important for each word and one can't classify them independently -> first and last names for instance, or words only indistinguishable via context (river bank, investment bank)).
 - architecturally speaking, [[id:4d58e957-2281-4bd5-82b9-1d12e7edfc74][Conditional Random Fields]] are popular sequence classifier choices.
