* Overview
- Software Defined Radio (SDR) refers to a radio communication system where components typically implemented in hardware (e.g., mixers, filters, amplifiers, modulators, demodulators, detectors) are instead implemented by means of software on a personal computer or embedded system.
- SDR systems are versatile and adaptable, allowing developers to modify their radio protocols or frequencies solely through software changes, rather than alterations in hardware.
- The concept of SDR exploits the flexibility of modern computing architectures to accommodate multiple signal types or standards dynamically.

* Advantages
- *Flexibility*: SDRs can quickly adapt to new frequencies or standards as they emerge globally.
- *Cost Efficiency*: By eliminating the need for multiple hardware radios designed for various signals, SDRs potentially reduce hardware costs.
- *Multi-standard Support*: They support a variety of communications standards and protocols within the same hardware framework.

* Challenges
- *Processing Power*: SDR requires significant [[id:ba8ffe00-365d-42b4-9cb4-d9554490620e][digital signal processing]] (DSP) capabilities to handle real-time signal modulation/demodulation.
- *Latency*: Software processes can introduce latencies that are not present in traditional hardware radios.
- *Complexity in Design*: While SDRs support flexibility, designing robust software architectures that effectively implement desired functionalities can be complex.

* Core Components
- *RF Front End*: Captures and converts incoming radio signals into a form that can be processed by the ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter).
- *ADC/DAC*: Converts analog signals to digital (ADC) for processing, and vice versa (DAC) for transmission.
- *Digital Signal Processor*: Computes the necessary transformations on the digital signal.
- *Software Stack*: Controls all smart radio functions including filtering, modulation/demodulation, encoding, and decoding.

* Applications
- *Telecommunications*: Supporting multi-standard wireless communication networks.
- *Research*: Assisting researchers in developing and testing new communication protocols.
- *Defense and Public Safety*: Enabling secure, flexible communication channels on the field.

* Connections
- SDR can leverage modern advances in [[id:bc1cc0cf-5e6a-4fee-b9a5-16533730020a][cloud computing]] and [[id:db649cb6-047e-426e-8cdc-774586ef30a0][AI]] for adaptive signal processing.

* Critique on Current Limitations
- While SDR allows for rapid software changes, the dependency on high-performance computing resources might not be feasible in energy-constrained or resource-limited environments.
- Security might be a concern since the ease of reprogramming can potentially allow malicious modifications if proper security measures arenâ€™t implemented.
