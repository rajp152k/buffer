* Abstract
 - this a fairly vast umbrella node that helps pedagogically cover several concepts in computer science.
 - a structured end to end walk throught will follow some day but as of now, stitching together what I need in the moment patch by patch.
* Misc
** [[id:fc34b43d-57e6-49a7-a678-8ec9df4d0c55][Virtualization]]
** The Linux File System
Tree like, follows the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard][file system hierarchy]] standard (FHS).
With root level as currect file (directories are file as well), run: 
#+begin_src bash
tree -D -L 1 /  
#+end_src
*** /
 - the top level of the file system
 - The "root" 
*** /root
 - home directory for the root users
 - root specific configs, etc all go in here
*** /home
 - users' specific files in respective user directories
 - default login directories placed here
*** /boot
 - essentials needed to boot up a system 
 - bootloader files
 - root filesystem files
 - linux kernel files
 - other boot configuration
*** /bin
 - contains common binaries executable by all users in single-user mode
 - check the loc of the bin you want to examine via ~which~
*** /sbin
 - system binaries and executables reserved for the root user
 - for instance, reboot..
*** /dev
 - representative files of devices attached to the system
   - consoles, hard drives, peripherals
 - also server a storage for pseudo/virtual devices with no actual hardware associated to them
   - /dev/null for instance is a bottomless pit for bytes streamed into it
*** /etc
 - host specific system wide configuration files in here
   - configs for programs, startup and shutdown shell scripts
*** /lib, /lib32, /lib64
 - shared library images required by /bin and /sbin  
   - arch specific 32 and 64 if needed
*** /media
 - temporary sub directories on which removable media is automatically mounted
 - /media/cdrom for instance
*** /mnt
 - temporary mount point for removable media
 - mostly used to mount storage devices and partitions manually
*** /tmp
 - temporary files
 - cleaned upon reboot
*** /opt
 - third party repository installations go in here
 - think add-ons
 - software binaries manually compiled by the user go here
*** /var
 - variable files go here (constantly changing in size)
    - /var/log - Contains system and application log files.
    - /var/cache - Contains cached data from programs.
    - /var/mail - Contains usersâ€™ mailboxes
    - /var/spool - Comprises queued or spooled files for various programs.
    - /var/spool/cron - Contains spooled files for cron jobs.
    - /var/spool/at - Contains spooled jobs for at.
    - /var/spool/lpd - Contains spooled files for printing.
    - /var/opt - Contains variable data files for the /opt directory.
 - spools are short term buffers where data is cached before it can be processed (printing to the terminal for instance)
    - ~Simultaneous Peripheral Operations On-Line~
*** /run
 - stores volatile run time data
 - not persistent across reboots
*** /proc
 - virtual file system : special files for running processes and kernel's current state
 - information and control center of the linux kernel
 - pseudo cause doesn't exist when system powered off
 - mounted on /proc when booting up
*** /usr
 - libraries, binaries and documentations for installed software applications
*** /srv
 - srv = service
 - site specific data for that linux distro
 - points to loc of files for specific services (www, FTP, rsync, CVS)
*** /sys
 - pseudo file system for virtual files attached to the linux kernel
** Init System
 - checkout : https://container.training/intro-selfpaced.yml.html#618
** NameSpaces
 - provide processes with their own view of the system
 - drop in conceptual replacement for UIDs
 - namespaces available in modern kernels:
 - checkout : https://container.training/intro-selfpaced.yml.html#705
** Linux Security Modules (LSMs)
