I don't stress out unnecessarily but I do believe I lack the ability to relax well. All my hobbies that I engage in without guilt are in someway chosen to aid my productivity and get more done. I think I don't have the ability to relax. Everything drains me. I'm prone to burnouts but I've had this feeling for a long time now and it feels normal. Haven't experienced a burnout in a long time and feel like I'm used to it now.

I still miss feeling genuinely relaxed though. I don't know how I'm going to achieve it. I guess trying defeats the purpose.
