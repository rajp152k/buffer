#+title: Infrastructure Lifecycle
#+filetags: :infra:cs:

* Overview
*** Key Components

1. *Planning*: Identifying the need for infrastructure, defining its scope, and outlining the requirements.
2. *Design*: Creating detailed designs and architectures for the infrastructure.
3. *Procurement*: Acquiring the necessary hardware, software, and services.
4. *Implementation*: Deploying and configuring the infrastructure components.
5. *Operations*: Managing and maintaining the infrastructure to ensure it operates as intended.
6. *Maintenance*: Performing routine updates, repairs, and replacements to keep the infrastructure functional and up-to-date.
7. *[[id:8f401b28-efb8-49e3-b1c6-02f101341669][Monitoring]]*: Continuously observing the infrastructure's performance and health.
8. *Decommissioning*: Retiring infrastructure that is no longer needed or has reached the end of its life.

*** Analysis of Relationships and Interactions

- *Planning* influences *Design* by providing the initial requirements and scope.
- *Design* guides *Procurement* and *Implementation* by detailing what needs to be acquired and how it should be deployed.
- *Procurement* affects *Implementation* by delivering the necessary components.
- *Implementation* feeds into *Operations* and *Maintenance* as the infrastructure is handed over for management and upkeep.
- *Operations* and *Maintenance* are interlinked; operations require maintenance to continue functioning, and maintenance is guided by operational feedback.
- *Monitoring* informs *Operations* and *Maintenance* by providing real-time data on the infrastructure's state, allowing for swift responses to issues.
- *Decommissioning* is influenced by *Monitoring* and *Maintenance*, as the decision to decommission is often based on performance, cost, and the availability of newer, better alternatives.

*** Breaking Down into Simpler Parts

1. *[[id:653e2ab1-7711-4cef-9bf7-9bf94fe81756][Lifecycle]] Phases*: The infrastructure lifecycle can be seen as a series of phases (Planning through Decommissioning) that are interconnected.
2. *[[id:88a94ee1-76d1-4e2a-8b3d-36a49345ace6][Feedback Loops]]*: Critical for the system's efficiency, feedback from later stages (like Monitoring) informs earlier stages (like Planning and Design) to improve the lifecycle process.
3. *[[id:cb578449-b5e0-4d79-bce4-ed26252cd3e9][Resource Flow]]*: Resources (financial, human, material) flow through these phases, being allocated and reallocated as necessary.
