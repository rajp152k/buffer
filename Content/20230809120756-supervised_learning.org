* Abstract
The major point of differentitiation initiates from how the relevant dataset is structured.
** Dataset 
 - a collection of labelled examples
   - feature vectors
   - associated ground truths
** Objective
 - use the dataset to [[id:17d3a745-72b6-4cf7-a0a2-ed5ff69830bf][train]] a model
 - the model should then be able to process the input into a useful metric that allows one to deduce the associated label for that feature vector
