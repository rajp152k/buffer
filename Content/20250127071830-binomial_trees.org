* Overview

- *Definition of Binomial Trees*:
  - A binomial tree is a data structure that is a recursive combination of binomial trees, each representing a set of potential states or values at each node.

- *Structure*:
  - A binomial tree of order \( k \) consists of \( 2^k \) nodes.
  - Each node has \( k \) children, corresponding to the structure of the binomial coefficient.

- *Properties*:
  - The height of a binomial tree of order \( k \) is \( k \).
  - There are \( C(k, i) \) ways to choose \( i \) children from \( k \).

- *Operations*:
  - *Merge*: Merging two binomial trees is efficient, \( O(\log n) \).
  - *Insert*: Inserting a new element is also \( O(\log n) \).
  - *Delete*: Deletion can be done in logarithmic time as well.

- *Applications*:
  - Commonly used in the implementation of priority queues, particularly in [[id:a1958360-5d36-4994-a617-37c040f78812][Fibonacci heaps]].
  - Useful in algorithms for binomial queues and efficient algorithms in [[id:dd94cae5-96e2-4a46-9890-41c8c88059bc][network design]].
