#+title:  SSL Passthrough

* Overview

- *Definition*: SSL passthrough is a method of handling [[id:06fa9da7-4126-4b08-a367-3a751f31de51][SSL]] traffic by allowing encrypted connections to pass through a [[id:0d7c2dea-a250-4380-b826-ad4d2547d8d6][load balancer]] directly to the backend server without [[id:b3e9b8d9-52cd-4e30-a148-02fbe76f205a][terminating]] the SSL connection.
- *Benefits*:
  - Enhanced security by maintaining end-to-end encryption.
  - Reduces complexity on load balancer since it doesnâ€™t decrypt the traffic.
  - Simplified certificate management since certificates are only required on backend servers.
- *Use Cases*:
  - Ideal for applications requiring strong encryption.
  - Suitable for environments with stringent compliance and security requirements.
- *Challenges*:
  - Limited traffic management capabilities since the load balancer can't inspect decrypted content.
  - Potentially increased latency if SSL handshakes occur at backend servers.
