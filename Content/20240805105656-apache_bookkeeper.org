* Basics

- a distributed log storage service.

** Key Features

- provides high durability and [[id:20240519T152842.050227][availability]] for storing logs (write-ahead logs, transaction logs).

- offers a scalable, [[id:20240519T162542.805560][fault-tolerant]], and low-latency storage solution.

- ensures consistent, ordered, and replicated logs.

** Working Mechanism

bookkeeper separates storage and serving roles:

- *bookies:* individual storage nodes (similar to datanodes in [[id:7aa94354-25d9-441b-993f-31ccc970edd3][hadoop]]) responsible for storing log fragments.

- *metadata storage:* tracks bookie locations and log segment metadata ([[id:b635cd13-0e7b-4d3e-aa3e-24ad0c3df768][zookeeper]] is commonly used).

- *clients:* write and read entries to/from bookkeeper (e.g.,[[id:5e438030-0096-4b97-8931-f99eb7b738c5][apache pulsar]]).

** Use Cases

- [[id:a3d0278d-d7b7-47d8-956d-838b79396da7][distributed]] [[id:1073cfed-a09d-48b6-bd52-ba09708699bf][messaging systems]]: providing durable and replicated storage for message streams.

- write-ahead logging: ensuring data consistency and recovery for databases and other systems.

- ledger storage: offering a reliable and performant foundation for distributed ledgers.

** Advantages

- *high throughput and low latency:* designed for high-performance logging operations.
- *scalability:* easily scales horizontally by adding more bookie nodes.
- *durability and availability:* replicated storage ensures data durability and availability.
