The art of persuasion.

An interesting way to practice rhetoric would be to deliberately position yourself in logically tough spots in an argument and trying to defend yourself by attacks from the metaphorically higher ground.

A modern day realization of this concept might be termed as playing "the devil's advocate".

Being able to defend oneself in such simulations should definitely help with developing a sense of rhetorical grit when it comes to your daily arguments with yourself.
