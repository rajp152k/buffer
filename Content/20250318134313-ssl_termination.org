* Overview

- *Definition of SSL Termination*:
  - The process where [[id:06fa9da7-4126-4b08-a367-3a751f31de51][SSL]] (Secure Socket Layer) [[id:92342b8b-1c09-4e1f-9799-66d060678c31][encryption]] and [[id:c9af7908-5a60-4ddd-a885-d83c3afbe982][decryption]] occurs at a designated endpoint.

- *Functional Purpose*:
  - Enhances performance by offloading SSL processing from web servers.
  - Simplifies certificate management, as only the termination point needs a valid certificate.

- *Common Use Cases*:
  - [[id:0d7c2dea-a250-4380-b826-ad4d2547d8d6][Load balancers]] or [[id:7bff6f16-de9c-4c0d-a9a1-b27e3da6725f][reverse proxies]] handling SSL termination.
  - Secure communication for web applications.

- *Advantages*:
  - Improved server performance due to lesser CPU load.
  - Centralized SSL certificate management reducing operational overhead.
  - Enhanced monitoring capabilities for incoming traffic.

- *Limitations*:
  - Potential security concerns if traffic is not re-encrypted after termination.
  - Additional layer that must be secured.

- *Deployment Considerations*:
  - Placement of SSL termination within the network architecture.
  - Balance between security and performance needs.

*** Clarifying Questions
1. What specific aspect of SSL termination are you interested in (e.g., security, performance, implementation)?
2. Are you looking to compare SSL termination with another method (e.g., SSL passthrough)?
