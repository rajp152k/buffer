 - community driven and dedicated to FOSS philosophy
 - distributed search and analytics engine
* Strengths
    - Fast full-text search (like [[id:a5d7c19d-d30a-466a-bac3-14d111278fcd][Elasticsearch]])
    - Scalable to large datasets and queries
    - Real-time data ingestion and [[id:656af4b9-648b-41f9-932b-cbf2d2017794][search]]
    - Analytics capabilities (aggregations, metrics)
* diff'd w/ BLEK
| Component     | OpenSearch Equivalent       | Notes                                                                                                                 |
|---------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Elasticsearch | OpenSearch                  | Core search and analytics engine. Functional overlap, but OpenSearch is a fork, not a drop-in replacement.            |
| Kibana        | OpenSearch Dashboards       | Visualization and management. Feature parity still developing.                                                        |
| Logstash      | No direct equivalent        | OpenSearch can ingest data directly or via tools like Fluentd/Fluent Bit.                                             |
| Beats         | Partially covered by agents | OpenSearch offers some data shippers (agents), but not the breadth of Beats. Community-driven alternatives may exist. |
