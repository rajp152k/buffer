# PICC: pragmatics of intellectual consumption and creation

Managing one's intellectual appetite in these times where information
(and - a lot of - noise) on any domain is available effortlessly and
in vast amounts is quite an ordeal. Even though we have superior
tooling and methods at our disposal to plough through these dense
knowledge forests, coming up with the right set of tools for
oneself is a commendable task in itself. In this post, I sketch out
how one could go about making such choices practically, from why you
should bother to what tangible actions you can get started with to set
yourself off on this journey sensibly.

### Pre-requisites

- The following is of no use to you if you aren't a little info-hungry
and are just the "when I cross that bridge" guy : any pursuit today
requires maintaining efficient intellectual pipelines I hope this
isn't an after-thought for you.
- A welcome plus would be if your eyes twinkle at the idea of
manipulating your notes pretty close to the speed of thought. That would
involve the following operations:
- search
- edit (additions/prunes)
- creating linkages
- observing backlinks
- being able to maintaining large mental and external caches
relevant to a domain
- training explicitly with these tools with real projects

With that out of the way, ...

## Why bother ..

 .. finding the best tools and methods for your needs when
generic-solutions are good-enough and allow you to get started without
an extensive setup?  

I'd say this is a short term play and doesn't take into account, the
future you's convenience. You might get a project's knowledge base
maintained via one set of principles and tools but that's not the only
one you'll do throughout your life. You might wish to port ideas
between projects maintained via different methods or would even like
to maintain generic notes that don't fit for a project. It'll be a
large unelegant mess if you don't actively invest some effort into
getting things right before you begin. Although it might slow you down
for the sprint, you'll be better off in the marathon. Efficiency in
the wild isn't about linear progress but phases of waxing and
waning. You might ultimately reach a ceiling that is way beyond your
expectations from when you started out - you'll have your past self's
grit and obsession with productivity to thank for. However, rather
than going all out right away, easing into this idealogy of a
controlled obsession will keep you in the game longer.  

Before proceeding towards the specifics, understanding ... 

## .. When ..

 .. to cash in your profits and cut down on your proverbial "time"
 loss is tricky to figure out - you might fall for the trap that
 sophisticated procrastination is. I personally prefer learning
 aggressively during rests between major projects and then
 incorporating what meta-skills I learned actively into the next
 project. These long consolidation phases really do help with this
 problem and you really know for sure if switching to the "better" now
 would offset the short term demands or not.  
 
## What ..

.. core activities should you focus on when getting started with this
pursuit?  

Well, text is the common medium that can represent all that we wish to
with completeness. An image might be better suited to certain
individuals dependent on their work but text is complete and more
potent than images. Also, I'd suggest sticking to an electronic format
for your over-all store than hand-written notes due to obvious
reasons. Quills and parchments are romantic but highly
impractical.  

So, you like to get started with optimizing your basic IO with
computers and documents with some core skills like speed reading and
touch typing. The latter is considerably easier that the former to
maintain which - fortunately or unfortunately - means that you rent
the former skill -> you can lose it without regular practice and might
need considerable effort to be effortless again. You'll still always
be better than if you'd never picked it up but ..., it feels good to
 comprehend large sections of text quickly.

### Scratch

Context switching is a hurdle when you want to be speedy because most
tools have a different set of keybindings that they vouch for and it's
like working with people from different countries that only know their
native languages.
