#+title: CoreDNS
#+filetags: :network:cloud-native:cncf:

* Overview

- CoreDNS:
  - flexible and extensible DNS server that can serve as a kube-dns replacement in [[id:c2072565-787a-4cea-9894-60fad254f61d][Kubernetes]] environments.
  - written in Go and can handle multiple DNS protocols.

- Key Features:
  - Modularity: CoreDNS features a plugin-based architecture, allowing users to enable only the DNS features they need.
  - Plugins: Some essential plugins are health checks, cache functionality, load-balancing, and more.
  - Performance: Optimizes DNS response times and scales efficiently in cloud-native environments.

- Deployment and Use Cases:
  - Primarily used within Kubernetes clusters to resolve service names and other DNS records.
  - Can be used for service discovery in microservices architectures, external DNS resolution, and more.

- CNCF and Community:
  - CoreDNS is a graduated project within the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), indicating a mature community and governance policy.
  - Regular contributions and updates from a wide community base enhance its stability and security.

- Comparisons:
  - Compared to traditional DNS solutions, CoreDNS offers better integration with Kubernetes.
  - Unlike BIND, CoreDNS is focused on extensibility rather than merely offering comprehensive DNS services out-of-the-box.

* CoreDNS Plugins Overview
  - CoreDNS is a flexible and scalable DNS server.
  - CoreDNS can be extended and customized through plugins.
  - Plugins allow CoreDNS to serve various use cases, such as:
      - Caching
      - Load balancing
      - Service discovery
  - CoreDNS comes with a collection of built-in plugins.

- Key Built-in Plugins
  - *Cache*: Caches DNS responses to improve performance and decrease load.
  - *Forward*: Forwards queries to other nameservers, usually upstream.
  - *Grpc*: Provides functionalities over gRPC, applicable within service meshes.
  - *[[id:c2072565-787a-4cea-9894-60fad254f61d][Kubernetes]]*: Provides service discovery for Kubernetes clusters by managing DNS entries for Kubernetes resources.
  - *[[id:55a62ff7-7160-4e6e-9bb5-0df996bf995e][Prometheus]]*: Offers metrics collection and exposes them in a format compatible with Prometheus.
  - *Rewrite*: Allows modification of incoming DNS queries before processing.
  - *Health*: Provides a health endpoint for monitoring the state of CoreDNS.
