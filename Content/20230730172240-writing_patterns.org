 - my basic introduction setup is a concise 3 step process:
   - insert a relevant quote
   - highlight what issue this post addresses at a very high level
   - indicate with what depth, relevance this post addresses the highlighted issue
 - given equivalent connotations, I have a tendency to choose the rare variant:
   - consciously defaulting on using the well-known variants henceforth.
 - I also tend to use a lot of passive voice :- sounds a little too artificial..
   - actively shifting to active voice henceforth and choosing the former only when really justified.
