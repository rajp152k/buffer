#+filetags: :sec:cs:


* Outline
** Definition : layered [[id:6e9b50dc-c5c0-454d-ad99-e6b6968b221a][security]] paradigm enforcing multiple verification methods
*** Factors - something you know, have, are, somewhere you are, or something you do
** Types : knowledge, possession, inherence, location, and behavioral factors
*** Knowledge Factor : passwords, PINs, or security questions
*** Possession Factor : one-time password generators, smart cards, or mobile devices
*** Inherence Factor : biometric authentication, such as fingerprints or facial recognition
*** Location Factor : IP address, GPS, or device profiling
*** Behavioral Factor : patterns of user behavior, such as typing rhythms or browsing habits
** Implementation : layered authentication, MFA protocols, and adaptive authentication
*** MFA Protocols - OATH, U2F, or SAML
*** Adaptive Authentication - risk-based authentication and step-up authentication
** Benefits : enhanced security, reduced phishing, and regulatory compliance
*** Risk Reduction - mitigates password-only vulnerabilities
*** Audit and Compliance - meets security standards and regulations
** Challenges : complexity, user friction, and integration with existing infrastructure
*** Interoperability - integration with diverse systems and protocols
*** User Experience - balancing security with usability and minimal friction
