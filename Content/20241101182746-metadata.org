* Overview

*** Overview of Metadata

- *Definition*: Metadata is data that provides information about other [[id:d45dae92-5148-4220-b8dd-e4da80674053][data]], facilitating its organization, discovery, and understanding.

- *Types of Metadata*:
  - *Descriptive Metadata*: Information that helps to identify and discover a resource (e.g., title, author, keywords).
  - *Structural Metadata*: Information about the structure of a resource (e.g., how different components of a digital resource are organized).
  - *Administrative Metadata*: Details that aid in the management of a resource (e.g., creation date, file type, access rights).

- *Functions of Metadata*:
  - *Discovery*: Helps users locate resources efficiently.
  - *Management*: Enables better organization and usage tracking.
  - *Preservation*: Assists in understanding and maintaining digital resources over time.

- *Standards*: Metadata is often governed by standards, such as:
  - *Dublin Core*: A set of vocabulary terms for describing resources.
  - *MARC*: Machine-Readable Cataloging, used for bibliographic records.
  - *XML*: Extensible Markup Language, which is often used to structure metadata.

- *Applications*:
  - Used in various domains, including libraries, academia, and digital asset management.
  - Plays a crucial role in SEO (Search Engine Optimization) for web resources.

*** Connections Between Entities:
- Metadataâ€™s various types indicate that it can serve multiple purposes concurrently, assisting in discovery while also managing data effectively.
- Standards ensure interoperability across different systems and platforms, promoting data exchange and usability.
- The functions of metadata are critical in both digital resource management and content discoverability, affecting how users interact with and benefit from vast data collections.

* Distributed Big Data Metadata

*** Distributed Big Data Metadata

- Definition: Metadata specifically designed to manage and describe the vast, distributed datasets common in big data environments.

- Characteristics:
  - Scalability: Must efficiently manage large volumes of metadata across distributed systems.
  - Diversity: Must accommodate various types of data from multiple sources (structured, semi-structured, unstructured).
  - Real-time Updates: Needs the capability for real-time or near-real-time updates to accurately reflect changes in data.

- Types of Distributed Metadata:
  - Source Metadata: Information about where and how data was generated.
  - Data Lineage: Traces the origin and transformation of the data over time.
  - Quality Metadata: Describes the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of the data.

- Techniques for Managing Distributed Metadata:
  - Data Catalogs: Centralized repositories that keep track of all available datasets and their metadata.
  - Graph Databases: Utilize graph structures to represent relationships between data items and their metadata.
  - Distributed Ledger Technology: Blockchain can provide immutable records of metadata to enhance traceability.

- Challenges:
  - Integration: Difficulty in integrating metadata from disparate systems or platforms.
  - Consistency: Maintaining consistency across distributed sources can be hard due to the dynamic nature of big data.
  - Security: Protecting sensitive metadata in a distributed environment.
