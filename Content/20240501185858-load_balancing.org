#+title: Load Balancing
#+filetags: :network:web:

* Abstract
 - Revolves around the idea of balancing requests over a pool of resources to avoid the over-"load"ing of any single point of service.
 - Is placed between the client and a group of servers (server farm)
 - also see [[id:7bff6f16-de9c-4c0d-a9a1-b27e3da6725f][Reverse Proxy]] and how load balancing compares in the context of [[id:e944d11b-ba53-4dc1-aee9-3793f59be8ac][client-server architecture]]
 - A core component that defines a load balancer's behaviour is the way it balances traffics, i.e. the underlying [[id:7f960631-c727-41b8-80c2-3ccaa4ae4ba2][scheduling algorithm]]
   - it can either be static (uses a predefined strategy) or dynamic (routes traffic based on the current state of the load balancer)
* Benefits
** Availibility 
 - Regular health checks
 - automatic disaster recovery
 - phased upgrade strategies without downtime
** Scalability
 - avoids over"load"ing a single server
 - traffic prediction capabilities for auto-scaling
 - redundancy allows scaling confidently
** Security
 - monitor traffic and block malicious content : see [[id:49fee858-eb36-4230-8eb0-881df964aec8][Web Application Firewall]]s for an elaboration
 - redirect attack traffic to multiple backend servers to minimize impact
** Performance
 - evenly distributed loads help improve response times
 - can redirect requests to geographically closer servers
 - ensure the reliability of physical and virtual computing resources 
* OverArching Types
** Application Load Balancing
 - application level commuincation protocols influence routing decisions
** Network Load Balancing
 - Layer 4 traffic is examined (TCP/UDP) to influence routing decisions
** Global Server Load Balancing
 - Done across geographically distributed servers
 - traffic redirected to a geographically closer server
** DNS Load Balancing
 - traffic can be distribued across multiple servers (IP addresses, to be specific) for higher availibility and performance
