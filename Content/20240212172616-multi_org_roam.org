#+title: Roam Env
#+filetags: :emacs:project:

* Abstract
Currently org-roam only allows for a single database and consequently a workspace. If you do have a separate directory, the database will still be mixed up and would result in cross-pollution of workspaces.

A quick solution would be to build a basic context managing wrapper on org-roam that manages these variables and allows for switching safely between org-roam.

Haven't settled on the name as of now and am inclined towards roam-env

* Result
 - check out [[id:e4c2e713-be21-4b79-871a-34eabe93e09d][nth-roam]]
 - basic context manager for db and dir
