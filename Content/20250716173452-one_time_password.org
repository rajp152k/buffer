#+filetags: :sec:cs:

* Outline
** Definition : Cryptographic hash based authentication
*** Hash chain - Lamport's scheme
*** HOTP - HMAC based One Time Password
*** RFC 4226
*** Counter synchronization
*** TOTP - Time based One Time Password
*** RFC 6238
*** Time step and clock drift compensation
** Security Aspects : Entropy, non-reusability, and resistance to replay attacks
*** Non-reusability - Hash chain or counter
*** Resistance to replay attacks - Timestamp or counter
** Implementation Considerations : Schema definition
*** Constraint definition - Predicates on state
*** State definition - Tuple or complex type
*** Composition of constraints - Schema instantiation
*** Constraint examples - Hash verification, timestamp check
** Use Cases : Authentication, Transaction verification
*** Two-factor authentication - OTP as second factor
*** Transaction verification - OTP as confirmation code
