* Overview

** State Machines Overview

*** Key Components
- States: distinct statuses or situations in a system
- Transitions: changes from one state to another
- Events: triggers that cause transitions
- Initial State: the starting state of the system
- Final State(s): the ending state(s) of the system

*** Connections
The components of a state machine are interconnected:
- States are connected through transitions.
- Events trigger transitions between states.
- The initial state is the starting point, and final states are the endpoints.

*** Clarifying Questions
To further understand the context, consider the following questions:
- What type of system is being modeled by the state machine?
- Are there any specific events or transitions that need to be highlighted?

*** Research Pathways
Exploring state machines further could involve:
- Investigating applications of state machines in different domains (e.g., software development, control systems, or modeling complex behaviors).
- Examining various types of state machines (e.g., deterministic vs. non-deterministic, Mealy vs. Moore machines).

** Simple State Machine Example

Consider a basic turnstile state machine:

| Current State | Event      | Next State | Description          |
|---------------|------------|------------|----------------------|
| Locked        | Coin       | Unlocked   | Unlocks on coin      |
| Unlocked      | Push       | Locked     | Locks on push        |
| Locked        | Push       | Locked     | Remains locked       |
| Unlocked      | Coin       | Unlocked   | Remains unlocked     |

This table illustrates the states (Locked, Unlocked), events (Coin, Push), and transitions between them.

To further explore state machines, we could ask:
- How can state machines be used to model more complex systems?
- What are the advantages and limitations of using state machines for system design?
