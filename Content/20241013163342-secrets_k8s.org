* Basics
  - Kubernetes secrets manage sensitive data, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys.
  - Secrets are intended to decouple sensitive information from the application code, improving security.
  - Deployments and pods can refer to secrets in Kubernetes, allowing controlled access.

* Security Considerations
  - Secrets, though more secure than embedding in application code, can still be exposed if someone gets access to the pod.
  - Best practices include [[id:fc79b8ad-6f4c-4a0b-b75e-f6ffd1741b52][ACLs]], [[id:91e6eae5-ebc3-4bf2-8523-30a29c60354c][RBAC]] policies, and [[id:92342b8b-1c09-4e1f-9799-66d060678c31][encryption]] at rest using third-party solutions or Kubernetes features.
