#+filetags: :ml:


A combination of [[id:90bcd50c-a360-4fd2-a5f2-356a6c7035cd][Supervised Learning]] and [[id:fded2ca7-e60a-4c83-842f-bc60f1ea5260][Unsupervised Learning]].
The dataset has labelled and unlabelled instances.
The objective is decided by the supervised learning task.
The learning variant in this case is to leverage the large number of unlabeled examples to improve model performane without asking an expert for additional labeled examples
