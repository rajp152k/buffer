* Overview
** *Definition and Scope*
  - Analytics refers to the systematic computational analysis of [[id:d45dae92-5148-4220-b8dd-e4da80674053][data]] or [[id:ed67b732-55bc-40a5-97d8-b9d16311e959][statistics]].
  - It is used for the discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns in data.

** *Types of Analytics*
*** Fundamental
  - *Descriptive Analytics*: Analyzes historical data to understand changes over time.
  - *Predictive Analytics*: Uses statistical models and forecasts techniques to understand the future.
  - *Prescriptive Analytics*: Suggests actions you can take to affect desired outcomes.
*** Application based
**** *Business Intelligence (BI):*
  - *Purpose:* Involves the use of data analysis tools to provide historical, current, and predictive views of business operations.
  - *Components:*
    - Data mining
    - Process analysis
    - Performance benchmarking
    - Descriptive analytics
  - *Outcomes:* Helps in making informed business decisions by highlighting trends and insights through dashboards and reports.

**** *Operational Analytics:*
  - *Purpose:* Focuses on monitoring and analyzing current business operations to improve efficiency and effectiveness on an ongoing basis.
  - *Components:*
    - Real-time data processing
    - Forecasting for operational efficiency
    - Optimization of business processes
  - *Outcomes:* Provides actionable insights to refine and optimize internal operations, enhancing productivity and minimizing waste.

**** *Embedded Analytics:*
  - *Purpose:* Integrates analytic capabilities directly into existing applications and business processes.
  - *Components:*
    - Seamless integration into software applications
    - Accessible analytics within operational workflows
    - Enhanced user engagement through context-specific insights
  - *Outcomes:* Offers users the ability to interact with analytics in real-time within the context of their daily tasks, driving informed decision-making as part of their standard operations.

**** *Connections:*
  - *BI vs. Operational Analytics:* While BI is more about strategic insights and long-term decision-making, operational analytics zeros in on the day-to-day workings and is more tactical.
  - *Operational vs. Embedded Analytics:* Both deal with real-time data, but embedded analytics specifically focuses on integrating insights directly into the operational tools users are already employing.
  - *BI vs. Embedded Analytics:* BI typically stands alone as a platform that requires user interaction to analyze data, whereas embedded analytics brings the insights into the tools and systems the user already interacts with daily.

** *Challenges*
  - Data Quality: Ensuring the accuracy and completeness of data.
  - Data Integration: Combining data from different sources.
  - Privacy and Security: Protecting sensitive data from breaches and misuse.

** *Connections:*
- The type of analytics used often correlates with business objectives, such as forecasting demand (predictive) or improving operational efficiency (prescriptive).
- Tools and technologies are selected based on the data complexity, volume, and specific use cases within an organization.
