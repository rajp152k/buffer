#+title: input-queue

I like reading technical books and am planning to expand my coverage to include foundational papers of some subjects that I find interesting: with the intention of understanding how subjects today interweave.
This buffer maintains a cache of technical papers/books/blogs/similar resources I'd like to go through. This is also an exercise in building up my reading efficiency for technical texts. I'm pretty quick with generic public domain non-fiction now and would like to up the ante: to maintain the effort I require to achieve [[id:20230718T223411.394444][flow]] (Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi).
I'll most likely begin with foundational papers in any domain and then explore depth if need be. will not be limiting myself to anything specific : anything goes - this is a new hobby.
I'd also like maintaining a log of all relevant articles/interviews/not-so-easily-indexable content that I've consumed [[id:ab47b014-ba85-4e68-8e61-6af7126dae1f][here]].
* Deferred Internal Index
Refraining from linking nodes as these are meta-informative and don't really point to populated nodes.
These are meant to be navigated with org-roam emacs and accessing them is convenient as is with helm-completion

 - stream node ~0x21B0~ of ~OOP~ root node
 - stream node ~0x21B0~ of ~Emacs~ tool node
 - complete first resource of ~Axiology~ meta root node and populate all relevances
 - fill in the basics of the ~Search~ node and initialize a project for your brain dump where you write a basic search engine for the same : i'm inclined towards a browser-based grep solution.
   - building an index is what I do for the main blog using lunr.js, but I'd like to experiment a little on the main site.
