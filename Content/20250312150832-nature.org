* Modern Lifestyle as Nature

- Modern lifestyles often diverge significantly from natural processes and [[id:3dbededb-a432-4a77-a41b-06965e81d525][rhythms]], leading to various epistemological and practical consequences.
- Disconnect from Nature: Increased urbanization, technology use, and sedentary habits result in reduced direct interaction with natural [[id:20240114T203953.456605][environments]].
- Altered [[id:bae838c7-eb56-4eaf-af5c-1a0caacab505][Sensory]] Input: Reliance on artificial environments and digital interfaces changes the types and range of sensory information received.
- Modified Cognitive Processes: Abstraction and symbolic representation become dominant modes of thinking, potentially diminishing embodied and contextual understanding.
- Changed Values: Consumerism and materialism can overshadow intrinsic appreciation for nature, impacting environmental ethics and behavior.
- Epistemological Blind Spots: Over-reliance on technological mediation may create biases in our perception and understanding of the world.
