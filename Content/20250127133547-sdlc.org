* Overview

- Definition: The SDLC is a systematic process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying software applications.

- Phases:
  - Requirement Analysis: Gather and analyze business requirements.
  - Design: Create architecture and design for the software.
  - Implementation (Coding): Translate design into the actual code.
  - Testing: Validate that the software functions as intended.
  - Deployment: Release the finished software to users.
  - Maintenance: Fix issues and make updates post-deployment.

* Models

- Waterfall Model:
  - Linear and sequential approach.
  - Each phase must be completed before the next begins.
  - Best for projects with well-defined requirements.

- [[id:4dbf6f2a-6e90-45a9-a51a-67d855858665][Agile]] Model:
  - Iterative and incremental approach.
  - Encourages adaptability and flexibility throughout development.
  - Involves continuous feedback and improvements.

- V-Model (Validation and Verification Model):
  - Extension of the Waterfall model.
  - Testing phase is planned parallel to each development stage.
  - Emphasizes the importance of validation and verification.

- Iterative Model:
  - Development is broken down into smaller parts.
  - Each iteration uses feedback to refine the product.
  - Welcomes changes even late in the process.

- Spiral Model:
  - Combines iterative development with the systematic control of the Waterfall Model.
  - Focuses on risk assessment and incorporates user feedback.
  - Repeated cycles (spirals) lead to gradual refinement.

- [[id:58ea31e4-95ae-4c25-b475-c8686fe23817][DevOps]] Model:
  - Integrates development and operations for streamlined processes.
  - Focuses on automation and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CICD).
  - Enhances collaboration and reduces time-to-market.

- RAD (Rapid Application Development):
  - Emphasizes rapid prototyping over extensive planning.
  - Users are involved throughout the development process.
  - Fast-paced, suitable for projects with time constraints.
