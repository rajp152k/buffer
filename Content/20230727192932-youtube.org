* History
 - second youtube channel
   - first -> to practice rhetoric
   - did help with working out the kinks in my communication skills
* Abstract
 - writing a pretty good way to express yourself and show your work
 - albeit.., still incomplete : videos complement the process of expression
 - speaking into a camera, speaking from experiences, tricks you into thinking you're addressing a large audience - a pretty neat trick, I would say
 - I'm starting again with a slightly formal approach : https://www.youtube.com/@rajp152k 
* Settling into Niche
   - Some topics that I'll explore initially:
     - Emacs -> instructive/customization
     - Common Lisp -> instructive
     - Programming Language Theory (Racket)
     - Book Reviews/follow-throughs (non-fiction/technical)
     - Interesting Research from different domains
     - Workflows, tools for relevant tasks
     - the occasional philosophical rant
* The Long Term Plan
 - freedom of expression is a given
   - being free enough to express is what we generally lack...
 - targeting at least a video a week..
