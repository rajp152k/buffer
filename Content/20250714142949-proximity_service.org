#+title: Proximity Service
#+filetags: :design:swe:




* Outline
** Architecture
*** Distributed Microservices: RPC-centric, Stateless Workers
*** Geo-partitioning: Hashing, Quadtrees, S2 Cells
*** Real-time Indexing: LSM-trees, In-memory Caching
** Core Functionality
*** Location Ingestion: Stream Processing, Deduplication, Rate Limiting
*** Proximity Query: Index Lookups, Bounding Box/Sphere Spatial Search
*** K-Nearest Neighbors: Voronoi Tessellation, R-trees
*** Geo-fencing: Polygon Intersection, Event Triggers
*** Proximity Events: Pub/Sub, Webhooks, Push Notifications
** Data Model
*** Entity Representation: UUID, Coordinate (Lat/Lon), Timestamp, Metadata Blob
*** Index Structures: Geohashes, Quadtree Nodes, S2 Cell IDs
*** Persistence Layer: NoSQL (Cassandra/DynamoDB), Time-series DB (InfluxDB)
** Performance & Scalability
*** Low-latency Reads: Cache-coherency, CDN for Static Proxies
*** High-throughput Writes: Asynchronous Ingestion, Batching, Backpressure
*** Horizontal Scaling: Sharding, Dynamic Resource Allocation
*** Fault Tolerance: Replication, Leader Election, Circuit Breakers
** Use Cases
*** Location-based Advertising: Hyperlocal Targeting, Impression Triggers
*** Ride-sharing/Delivery: Driver-matching, ETA Calculation
*** Social Networking: Friend Discovery, Local Events
*** Asset Tracking: Fleet Management, Supply Chain Visibility
