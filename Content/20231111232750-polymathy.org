I've read quite a bit about being a modern renaissance man and I've decided I'm going to pursue several domains to keep my life interesting.

* The Intellectual Super-Villain's Reading List

Reading diversely is an integral part of such an endeavor. Given my Anti-Hero (I'm not a super-villain.., yet.) inclinations.. I'm creating a reading list that keeps my exploration directed and disciplined in terms of what I'd like to know.

The following are collations I intend to assimilate into my epistemological arsenal. 

Note that these should be treated as foundational reads. Always supplement with core textbooks from a specialist later down the lane.
Without conveying importance by the order, consider reading: [[id:e8c0b214-fa70-4462-8d44-ae0282d14981][The List]]
