#+title: Distributed Compute
#+filetags: :cs:

As the scale of the problem that one wishes to solve increases, several computers need to be able to [[id:a4e712e1-a233-4173-91fa-4e145bd68769][coordinate]] to solve the problem at hand, efficiently and correctly.

These "compute"rs might not even be the conventional computer that pops up in one's mind and might rather be a group of servers, database instances or several edge devices such as in [[id:3c0c2077-b24a-4f6b-b93f-f06c08f7b3e9][decentralized applications]].

The uniting feature of all distributed systems is that the workload is distributed on the constituent "compute"rs.

Some basic advantages of distributed compute:
 - efficiency increases if workload is distributed
 - fault tolerance in case of workload redundancy
 - execution modularity helps with debugging the specific module when an error arises rather than having to examine the whole code-base

A few trade-offs incurred due to the above:
 - latency increases due to the communication overhead
 - poor system design can affect user experience
