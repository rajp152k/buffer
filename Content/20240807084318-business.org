* Abstract

** Personal
This node set is the pragmatics of business, adapted to my (ever-evolving) incentives.

I have some formal education in Business (took Business Studies during GCSE for two years (age 14-16)) and I was always inclined towards creating value in a sustainable manner, with personal temporal freedom also being a major motivator.

Having recently begun working on [[id:95dd2f7c-e699-4ff6-9f40-52d573527107][theBitMage]], I want to fill in the gaps that the lack of practice has introduced in my approaches, over time.

This node-set is going to be a deep practical analysis of the aspects of business applied to my needs.

I am, as of 0x229F, in the dark when it comes to the ground realities of a operating a business. [[id:ab7c582a-9b00-4e4d-a71c-302efdc1f0e7][The iterative Read-Act-Write (RAW) protocol]] is being applied to this one. The contents encompassed can therefore be considered reliable.

Parallely initializing a fundamental read, I'll be conducting experiments on the aspects of this node set.
