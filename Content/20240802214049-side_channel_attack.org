#+title: side-channel-attack
#+filetags: :cs:sec:

* Overview

Side-channel attacks exploit information leakage from a system's physical implementation, rather than directly exploiting vulnerabilities in algorithms or code.

** Examples:

- Timing Attacks: Measuring how long a system takes to perform cryptographic operations to deduce secret keys (e.g., OpenSSL Heartbleed vulnerability).

- Power Monitoring: Analyzing the power consumption patterns of a device during cryptographic operations to reveal key information.

- Electromagnetic Emanations: Capturing electromagnetic signals emitted by a device to recover sensitive data (e.g., TEMPEST attacks).

** Caveats:

- Physical Proximity: Often require close proximity to the target system.

- Specialized Equipment: May necessitate expensive and sophisticated equipment.

** Mitigation

 - deliberate bottlenecks to mask internal differences can be useful (eg: [[id:89d7166b-f925-43d0-a74b-bcd53cdeab26][bcrypt's]] deliberately slow hashing function)
