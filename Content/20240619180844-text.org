Text in computer science is a sequence of characters representing human-readable information. This contrasts with binary data directly processed by computers. Ultimately, all data stored on computers is represented by bits, but human-readable text is a happy medium that seems to be a good intermediary towards better interacting with machines in an efficient manner.

Efficient Text manipulation is then a good tool to have in your utility belt.
