* Overview

- *Definition*: A Bitmap (bit array or bitmap image) is a data structure that represents a grid of bits, which can be used to store polarities of binary states (0 and 1) or represent images.

- *Types*:
  - *1D Bitmap*: A single dimension, typically used for flags or status indicators.
  - *2D Bitmap*: Utilizes a grid for more complex representations, commonly found in images.

- *Formats*: Bitmaps can come in various formats, such as:
  - *BMP*: Bitmap image file format, primarily for encoding raster graphics.
  - *GIF*: Graphics Interchange Format, often uses a palette and supports animations.
  - *PNG*: Portable Network Graphics, allows for lossless compression.
  - *TIFF*: Tagged Image File Format, often used in professional photography and publishing.

- *Applications*:
  - *Graphics Rendering*: Bitmaps hold image data in graphics systems (e.g., video games, user interfaces).
  - *Database Indexing*: Bitmap indexes efficiently represent the presence/absence of values in large datasets.
  - *Digital Imaging*: Used in digital cameras and scanners to represent pixel-based images.

- *Advantages*:
  - Simple representation of binary states.
  - Efficient for certain types of data querying (especially in databases).

- *Disadvantages*:
  - Can consume large amounts of memory depending on size and color depth.
  - Not ideal for scalable graphics (vector graphics are preferred in such cases).

*** Connections:
- Bitmaps are intrinsically linked to binary data representation, making them fundamental in computing for both graphics and data management.
- The choice of bitmap format can significantly affect the efficiency of data storage and transmission, relating to compression methods and image quality.
- Bitmap indexes in databases leverage the efficiency of bit-level representation to optimize query performance, showcasing a cross-disciplinary application in computer science.
