#+title: Static Typing
#+filetags: :plt:cs:

* Overview

- *Definition*: Static typing is a programming language feature where data types are checked at compile time rather than at runtime.

- *Benefits*:
  - *Type Safety*: Helps identify type-related errors before execution, reducing runtime errors.
  - *Performance*: Can lead to optimizations as the compiler can make informed decisions about memory management and execution paths.
  - *Tooling Support*: Enhanced capabilities for IDEs and tools for features like autocompletion and refactoring.

- *Drawbacks*:
  - *Complexity*: Can make code harder to write due to mandatory type declarations.
  - *Rigidity*: Less flexible when making quick changes or designing dynamic systems.

- *Examples of Statically Typed Languages*:
  - Java
  - C++
  - C#
  - Rust
  - Haskell

- *Comparison with [[id:e7b5a97b-7843-489c-a8ca-5faa857a6755][Dynamic Typing]]*:
  - *Dynamic Typing*: Checks types at runtime, leading to potentially faster initial development, but with a higher risk of runtime errors.
  - *Statically Typed*: Requires explicit declaration of variable types, often resulting in fewer logical errors.

*** Connections

- *Type Systems*: Both static and dynamic typing are approaches within type systems that directly influence program reliability and maintainability.

- *Memory Management*: Statically typed languages typically offer more control over memory allocation, which can lead to more efficient performance.

- *Development Tools*: The presence of strong type systems in statically typed languages facilitates advanced tooling, such as type inference and static analysis.

*** Questions for Further Research
- How do specific statically typed languages implement and enforce their type systems?
- What are common patterns or practices in statically typed languages that help manage complexity?
- In what scenarios might a statically typed language be preferred over dynamically typed languages, and why?
- How do other programming paradigms (such as functional programming) interact with the principles of static typing?
