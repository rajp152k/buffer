* Definition
  - a unique numeric label assigned to each device connected to a [[id:a4e712e1-a233-4173-91fa-4e145bd68769][computer network]] that uses the IP for communication.
  - two primary functions:
    - identifying a host or network interface
    - providing the location of the host in the network [[id:6bb5e976-0619-4a6e-8c6b-adb39d5dcc8c][topology]]

* Types of IP Addresses
** [[id:f3fda9d4-bfde-4672-8b51-a41700c0cd98][IPv4]]
    - Consists of 32 bits.
    - Forms over 4.3 billion unique addresses.
    - Format: four octets separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
** [[id:1a3d2a4c-bfad-4e5a-ab97-4db4531e7bd2][IPv6]]
    - Developed due to the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses.
    - Consists of 128 bits.
    - Can support about 340 undecillion addresses.
    - Format: eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

** [[id:1c4b02bf-2597-4e2d-9e85-1be4993dcb31][IPv5 Lore]]
* Static vs. Dynamic IP Addresses
  - Static IP Addresses
    - Permanently assigned to a computer by an ISP.
  - Dynamic IP Addresses
    - Temporarily assigned from a pool by the [[id:dd743d7a-7e96-45a7-9894-13f79b351681][DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)]].

* IP-related Concepts and Connections
** [[id:c1875db1-be4d-43fe-9c88-bf5fc7a95df3][DNS (Domain Name System)]]
    - Translates human-readable domain names to IP addresses.
** [[id:e6f902bf-c138-4d79-85cc-98f1165ef761][IP Subnetting]]
    - Divides a large network into smaller, manageable segments.
** [[id:2db5d39c-8f0d-4bcb-ba73-c5d4e22c4d03][NAT (Network Address Translation)]]
    - Allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address.

** [[id:74055437-5557-4a21-9b7a-a3b5df3a8a24][IPVS (IP Virtual Server)]]
** [[id:da013333-6224-466d-acbf-ad16d0c26104][Generic Routing Encapsulation]]
