* Abstract
When provisioning any abstraction as a service, there are four important aspects that need to be completely charted out before you proceed.
 - Installation
 - Configuration
 - Operation
 - Management

Try understanding this node in the context of [[id:bc1cc0cf-5e6a-4fee-b9a5-16533730020a][Cloud Computing]] considering the dimensions of compute, storage and networking facilitations.
