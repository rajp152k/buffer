* Abstract
 - need good env for emacs
 - all existing tooling is old
 - writing a language server sounds cool
* Architecture
** Phase 0
 - lsp-mode interacts with the lsp server
 - the lsp-server (could write in python /clojure) needs something like jedhy
 - thinking of going with clojure
   - https://github.com/clojure-lsp/lsp4clj
   - the python alternative is pygls
 - so separation of concerns leaves me with three things
   - lsp-mode for generic client interop (could do dap stuff)
   - the lsp-server using clojure lsp4clj
   - jedhy like autocompletion(and more) api
 - All three kinds of lisps : Hy, Clojure, Elisp  - definitely ambitious
   - that get's me thinking -> is there a lisp to quickly switch between all lisps out there with a flag, racket does come to mind but need to investigate after I experience the anticipated pain a little
 - quite some studying needed : jedhy seems natural starting point followed by learning clojure with good depth
 - gonna stick through this : meanwhile, need to level up my core swe skills while I'm at it
