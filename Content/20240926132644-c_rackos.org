- I planned on writing an operating system in racket, and then understood that there is a whole lot that I need to be conceptually clear about before I start incorporating alien tech into what I do.
- so this is going to start with me ditching the functional realm and actually getting down dirty with C.
- of course, this is a temporary detour : am looking forward to charting out some C
- that is actually my programmatic Alma Mater
- this could be an insanely long sub project of an insanely long project
