The principle data structure of the [[id:20230712T223044.319985][lisp]] programming language. As with any [[id:20230715T173535.681936][Data Structure]], it's built upon a primitive gluing functionality which is `cons` in lisp colloquial. 

some basic functionalities associated with a list:
 - peeping into () the top level glue (cons)
   - car,cdr and variants
 - manipulation
   - reversing, appending, etc

An intuitive enhancement in the complexity of a list can be represented by a list of lists (an association list aka table) : consisting of key value pairs.
