See [[id:0fb8c9c4-f491-4d40-b6b7-a6a331316c01][Classification]].

* Abstract
 - refers to the imbalance of the number of instances for each class in a data set
 - problems may arise in different stages of the [[id:b5bbb126-c808-468c-962d-8361aa8c8dd1][pipeline]] if a dataset is imbalanced and extra care may need to be taken for normal execution
 - may result in insufficient data to learn the characteristics of a specific class and distributionally non-conforming validation/training sets if one does not use stratification when splitting datasets.
 - Evaluation metrics may also be mislead if some classes are under-represented : this calls for a family of class-balanced loss functions/metrics for fair consideration of all classification in the training/evaluation process.
