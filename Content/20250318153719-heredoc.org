#+title: Heredoc
#+filetags: :unix:

* Overview

- *Definition*: Heredoc (here-document) is a feature in Unix and programming languages like Bash, Perl, and Python for defining multiline string literals.
- *Syntax*: A heredoc starts with =<<= followed by a delimiter (identifier) and ends with the same delimiter on a new line.
- *Usage*: Commonly used for passing blocks of text to commands, or for creating multi-line strings directly in the script.
- *Examples*:
  - Bash:

    #+begin_src bash
    cat <<EOF
    This is a heredoc example.
    It can span multiple lines.
    EOF
    #+end_src

  - Python:

    #+begin_src python
    multiline_string = """This is a heredoc in Python.
    It can also span multiple lines."""
    #+end_src
