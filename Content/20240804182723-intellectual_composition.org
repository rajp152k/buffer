#+title: Intellectual Composition
#+filetags: :meta:

The notion that any intellecual entity can be broken down into fundamental [[id:20240114T210722.836738][axioms]] and consequently be expressed as recursive compositions with axiomatic base cases.

Identifying a practical axiom that is abstract enough so as to not distract one with irrelevant details and fundamental enough that it can be reliably built upon is an interesting exercise.

Intellectual Composition (the operator) may be of several natures based on the constituent ideas (the operands).

The factors that would completely describe operands and the operator are, although practically in-enumerable, worth pseudo-exhautively enumerating.
