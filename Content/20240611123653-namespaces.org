* Overview
** Definition
    - A namespace is a container that holds identifiers, such as variables and functions, and ensures that they are unique within that context.
** Purpose
    - Resolves name conflicts arising from identifiers with the same name being used in different parts of a program.
    - Enhances code organization and modularity.
