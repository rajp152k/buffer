Natural language, unlike computer languages, are not completely structured; they may have rules but they also have eccentricities that may not be explicitly captured by rules/decisions but need more complex techniques to be employed: analyzing multiple patterns of a similar instance being one of them.

Solution approaches trickle down into  the following:

 - [[id:20230713T113547.742751][Symbolic AI]] (~heuristics)
 - A mixture of the above

 - when fitting a corpus to an nlp pipeline, do take note of the percentage of words that are OOV(if too high, you could training your own embedder instead of a pretrained embedder)
