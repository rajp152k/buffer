#+title: Consensus Algorithms
#+filetags: :cs:

* Purpose
Ensure agreement among computers (nodes) in a distributed system.
* Key Goals:
 - Agreement: All nodes decide on the same value.
 - Termination: Decision-making process ends.
 - Validity: Decided value was proposed by at least one node.
* Types
- Leader-Based: One node leads decision-making (e.g., [[id:327ebe76-4fd6-47d4-b053-94e380937c6d][Raft]], [[id:083ee4ac-c213-47d8-a2d9-4c56bf3cf9ea][Paxos]]).
    - Pro: Strong consistency
    - Con: Less available if leader fails
- [[id:20240519T200217.994784][Quorum]]-Based: Majority agreement required (e.g., Paxos variants).
    - Pro: Good availability
    - Con: Weaker consistency in network splits
- Proof-of-Work/Stake: Used in blockchains for transaction validation.
    - Pro: Secure, decentralized
    - Con: High energy consumption (PoW), potential centralization (PoS)
* Use Cases:
    * [[id:a3d0278d-d7b7-47d8-956d-838b79396da7][Distributed]] databases
    * Configuration management
    * Leader election
    * Blockchain
    * [[id:bc1cc0cf-5e6a-4fee-b9a5-16533730020a][Cloud computing]]
* Choosing
Depends on your system's needs for consistency, availability, [[id:20240519T162542.805560][fault tolerance]], performance, and scalability.
