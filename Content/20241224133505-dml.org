#+title: DML (Data Modeling Language)
#+filetags: :data:programming:

* Overview

- *Definition of DML ([[id:d45dae92-5148-4220-b8dd-e4da80674053][Data]] Modeling Language)*:
  - A formal language used to describe the structure and behavior of data.
  - Facilitates the creation, modification, and querying of data models.

- *Properties*:
  - *[[id:20231212T081907.908301][Declarative]] Nature*: Allows users to state what to achieve rather than how to achieve it.
  - *Representation of Data*: Defines rules and relationships between different data entities.
  - *Interoperability*: Can be used across various [[id:2f67eca9-5076-4895-828f-de3655444ee2][database]] management systems (DBMS).
  - *Modeling Constructs*: Typically includes types, attributes, domains, keys, and relationships.

- *Common Use Cases*:
  - Database design and schema generation.
  - Data integration and migration between systems.
  - Data analytics and reporting frameworks.

- *Examples of DMLs*:
  - SQL (Structured Query Language)
  - ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) languages like Hibernate, Entity Framework.
  - NoSQL languages like MongoDB's query language.

*** Connections:
- The *declarative nature* of DML is a significant factor in its use for *database design*, as it promotes clarity in defining what data is needed.
- The *interoperability* of DML spans across different DBMS, which underscores its importance in *data integration* tasks.
- The *modeling constructs* mentioned are vital for understanding and structuring data well, which can enhance *data analytics* efforts.

*** Questions for Further Clarity:
- What specific applications or industries are you interested in regarding DML?
- Are there particular DML standards or frameworks you're considering exploring?
