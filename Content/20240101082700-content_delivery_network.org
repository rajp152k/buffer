* Overview

- *Definition*: A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a [[id:a3d0278d-d7b7-47d8-956d-838b79396da7][distributed]] network of servers that work together to deliver web content to users more efficiently.
- *Purpose*: The primary aim of a CDN is to improve website speed and performance by caching content closer to the userâ€™s geographical location.

- *Components*:
  - *Edge Servers*: These are servers located closer to end-users that cache copies of content.
  - *Origin Server*: The primary server where the original content is stored.
  - *Points of Presence (PoPs)*: Data centers located in various regions that host edge servers.

- *Benefits*:
  - *Reduced Latency*: Decreases the time it takes for content to reach a user.
  - *Improved Load Times*: Enhances the loading speed of websites.
  - *Scalability*: Provides resources to handle traffic surges effectively.
  - *Reliability*: Increases uptime through redundancy and load balancing.
  - *Security Enhancements*: Offers features such as DDoS protection and HTTPS support.

*Connections*:
- The relationship between edge servers and origin servers showcases the core functionality of a CDN in optimizing content delivery.
- [[id:4ea4dfa7-04af-418f-a07b-b1162bb0c19c][Point of Presence]] (PoP) locations demonstrate how geographical distribution plays a critical role in reducing latency and improving user experience.
- CDN security features illustrate how performance and security are interlinked, ensuring that faster content delivery does not compromise user safety.
