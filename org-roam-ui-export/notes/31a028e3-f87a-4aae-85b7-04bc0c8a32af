** Types
*** Generative Classifiers
 - model probablility of observing a data point's feature set given the label and report the argmax
*** Discriminative Classifiers
 - model the joint probability distribution of the feature-label set report the one with the max probabilty 
** Examples
*** Naive Bayes
 - naive usage of the bayes theorem.
 - prediction is the class which has the highest likelihood given the current data point.
 - the distribution to evaluate the above likelihood is built from the dataset.
 - example of a generative classifier
*** Logistic Regression
 - example of discriminative classifier* Classification Evaluation Metrics
 - slap on a logistic function on top of a regressor
 - serves as a quick baseline (see [[id:8c6bce48-0cac-487c-8789-e08f22c00094][MVP]])
*** Support Vector Machine
 - tries finding a separation hyperplane post mapping(via a kernel function) data points to a higher dimensional space
 - unlike logistic regression, can deal with non-linear boundaries
 - can take longer to train
*** Deep Learning based
 - don't use a hammer when pliers get it done elegantly.
 - The usage is reduced down to the formulation of the feature set and labels in a format that's compatible with deep learning algorithms

    - relevant architectures : CNNs, RNNs and more complex variants
 - [[id:64c6a881-ef47-4973-a821-34e0cc085f34][Transfer Learning]] methods are increasingly more feasible today: finetuning a generically pretrained large neural network can produce good results fairly quickly.
