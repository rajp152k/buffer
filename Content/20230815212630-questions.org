* Abstract

Questions that I accumulate over time in different situations and don't have an obvious reasonable answer for right away..

* Questions
 - Sometimes, I catch myself wishing I was born centuries ago when times were simpler. I'm yet to give it a serious thought but do I really wish for it? -> need to investigate.
