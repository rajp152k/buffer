#+title: SAML
#+filetags: :sec:cs:

* Outline
** Definition : Security Assertion Markup Language, XML-based SSO standard
*** Key components : assertions, protocols, bindings
*** Assertions : statements about identity, attributes, authentication

** Architecture : Identity Provider (IdP), Service Provider (SP), User Agent
*** Roles : authentication, authorization, attribute exchange

** Protocols : SAML 2.0, SAML 1.1
*** Bindings : HTTP Redirect, HTTP POST, SOAP

** Use Cases : Single Sign-On (SSO), Single Sign-Out (SLO), Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC)
*** Applications : enterprise software, cloud services, web applications
* Conceptual Models
** Systems Theory & Cybernetics
*** State: Identity assertions, authentication status
*** Inputs: User credentials, authentication requests
*** Processes: Authentication, authorization, attribute exchange
*** Outputs: Security assertions, access grants
*** Feedback Loop: Identity validation, session management

** Mathematical Modeling
*** Graph Theory: Identity graph
*** Nodes: Users, identity providers, service providers
*** Edges: Authentication, authorization, attribute sharing
*** Category Theory: Identity morphisms
*** Objects: Identity assertions, users
*** Arrows: Authentication, attribute exchange

** Computer Science & Algorithmic Structures
*** Data Structure: XML documents
*** Elements: Assertions, protocols, bindings
*** Algorithm: Digital signature generation
*** Hash functions: SHA-1, SHA-256
*** Encryption: Asymmetric cryptography (RSA, ECC)

** Information Theory
*** Channel: Communication channels (HTTP, SOAP)
*** Signal: Security assertions, authentication requests
*** Noise: Replay attacks, tampering
*** Capacity: Authentication throughput, assertion freshness

** Control Theory
*** Controller: Identity provider (IdP)
*** Observer: User agent
*** Setpoint: Authentication status
*** Stability: Session management, revocation

** Economic Modeling
*** Game Theory: Authentication games
*** Players: User, IdP, SP
*** Strategies: Authentication, authorization
*** Mechanism Design: Incentive-compatible authentication

** Physics & Thermodynamics
*** Analogy: Physical identity (passport)
*** Energy: Authentication effort
*** Entropy: Identity uncertainty, assertion freshness
