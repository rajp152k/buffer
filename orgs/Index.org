* Semantics
** Expected content and incentive
I do read a lot and have a tendency to forget all that I've learned.
This personal epistemological wiki serves the following (not an exhaustive list) purposes
 - collection of links and resources of all knowledge that I accumulate for quick overviews
 - philosophical perception of the underlying tool being used so as to really identify its utility
 - fodder for new projects and technical blogs
 - a reference for all content that I create
** Meta-Data rules
*** Time stamps
 - do not use time-stamps
 - this is mutable storage with an immutable edit history
   - delegating the immutability part to git
   - consequently : edit freely
*** Tags
Employing two classes of tags: exactly one tag from each class has to be used when initializing a node
**** State
These describe the core nature of a node (Expect large temporal inertia):
     1. Root : any root node of a major epistemological prominence
     2. Link : any node consolidating information from two or more nodes 
	- usually will result in the ideation of a new root
     3. Spec : is an epistemological specialization of an existing Root node
**** Reliability
These intend to capture the maturity of a particular node:
     1. Volatile : All nodes start out this way - yet to be consolidated appropriately into the epistemological forest
     2. Stable : Information in this node is well-researched and can be trusted - appropriate citations can be found in the node
     3. Transient : has accumulated mass but loopholes may exist in what has been written down - This is pseudo-science territory
     4. Archived : No longer relevant - usually will refer to tooling that actually exists and not an abstract concept
*** Linkages
 - Everything need not be connected: avoid using unnecessary linkages
 - Prefer Intra-file development to Inter-file expansion
*** External Media
 - Preferably should be esoteric content that isn't well indexed by search engines 
   - blogs, links to research papers, etc
 - avoid Wikipedia excerpts (consider this implicit)
 - no images
 - no mathematical notation : refer them via names
   - rendering latex is a luxury
   - going for minimalism
 - Avoid Verbosity : delegate it to the internet if possible
   - instead have commentary on resources that were referred
* [[id:4269][Buffer]] 
 - This node represents ideas that are very premature and need some more thought to be incorporated into the tree
 - No rules apply: except - This is the only linkage this node shares with the Epistemological Forest
   - Expecting several external linkages
 - shouldn't be taken seriously
