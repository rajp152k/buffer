This node captures misc information regarding the large root that ML is.
I plan on accumulating and assimilating all that I learn from various domains in a uniform manner here. It'll be notebooks from completed [[id:f275e17f-307e-4e2b-a67b-6511774d0a3d][kaggle]] competitions, blogs, papers, courses, anything that's worth goes in. I don't plan on incorporating complete book walkthroughs in here - I'll reference them and won't be mapping what I read verbatim. [[id:9539ffd2-433b-4cac-babc-0d45990a4642][Wikipedia]] is a good quick reference so will be referencing that too rather than typing what's within convenient reach.

** [[id:398d134d-6193-409a-b3b5-9e7c7de86ce7][Interpretable ML]]
 - ML models are generally a black box that are inexplicable representations of the data they are trained on.
 - understanding how a model favors certain outputs for a set of input features is a domain in itself.
** [[id:67812842-bd33-4927-a693-fdf02721b019][Mixture of Expert]]
** Universal Approximation Theorem
 - any mathematical function can be modelled with the desired level of accuracy given the right architecture and enough training
