#+title: Scheduling Algorithms
#+filetags: :programming:cs:

In computing, scheduling is the method by which threads, processes or data flows are given access to system resources. (wikipedia)

The scheduler is concerned mainly with:

 - throughput (total amount of work done per time unit);
 - turnaround time (between submission and completion);
 - response time (between submission and start);
 - waiting time (between job readiness and execution);
 - fairness (appropriate times according to priorities).

In practice, these goals often conflict.

"Scheduling" = decide which resources to use.

Incorporating multiple dimensions when modelling the priority functions is a difficult (and interesting) problem.
 - in the context of computer science, over the dimensions of compute, networking and storage, the idea of "scheduling" workloads gradually evolves into the idea of [[id:f822f8f6-89eb-4aa8-ac8f-fdcff3f06fb9][orchestration]]
