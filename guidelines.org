#+title: Curation Guidelines

* Roles and Responsibilities

This document outlines the roles and responsibilities for our pair-studying workflow aimed at building and leveraging an org-roam knowledge graph.

**Aider (AI Assistant)**
- **Primary Responsibility:** Providing and documenting "lower level hard knowledge, wisdom, and documentation".
- **Specific Tasks:**
    - Fetching and presenting factual information on requested topics.
    - Explaining concepts clearly and concisely.
    - Drafting initial documentation in org-mode format based on the information.
    - Suggesting relevant details or information points for inclusion.
    - Ensuring the accuracy and clarity of the documented knowledge.

**Raj (Human Curator)**
- **Primary Responsibility:** Analyzing, connecting, and leveraging the knowledge from an epistemological perspective.
- **Specific Tasks:**
    - Analyzing connections between different pieces of knowledge.
    - Identifying how knowledge can be applied to current contexts and leveraged.
    - Adding links (`[[link]]`) between relevant notes.
    - Assigning appropriate tags (`:tag:`) to notes.
    - Reviewing and refining the documented knowledge for structure and clarity.
    - Identifying novel problems and how to assimilate new information better.

**Shared Responsibilities**
- Both participants will contribute to tasks primarily assigned to the other role as needed.
- All knowledge and guidelines will be documented in org-mode files.
- All changes will be version controlled using Git.

* Modes of Operation

We will operate in distinct modes depending on the current goal, shifting focus between acquiring new knowledge and applying existing knowledge.

**Exploration Mode**
- **Goal:** To acquire new knowledge, understand novel concepts, and document them within the graph.
- **Aider's Focus:** Providing detailed explanations, definitions, historical context, and foundational principles related to the topic. Drafting initial notes.
- **Raj's Focus:** Asking clarifying questions, identifying key concepts, structuring the new notes, adding initial links and tags to place the new knowledge within the existing graph.

**Exploitation Mode**
- **Goal:** To leverage existing knowledge within the graph to solve problems, generate insights, or apply concepts to new contexts.
- **Aider's Focus:** Recalling and summarizing relevant documented knowledge, suggesting connections based on existing notes, providing examples of application.
- **Raj's Focus:** Formulating specific problems or contexts, querying the graph for relevant information, analyzing connections to find solutions or insights, refining existing notes based on application experience, identifying gaps in knowledge.

* Knowledge Collaboration DSL Specification

This section defines the natural language terms and patterns we will use to communicate about building and interacting with the knowledge graph. This serves as our domain-specific language for collaboration.

**Core Components:**

-   **Note/Concept:** Refers to an individual piece of knowledge, typically corresponding to an org-roam file or a significant heading within a file. We will refer to these primarily by their title or filename.
    -   *Example Usage:* "Let's create a note about [Topic Name]." "Referencing the note '[Existing Note Title]'..."
-   **Link/Connection:** Refers to the relationship between two notes, typically represented by an org-roam link (`[[roam:ID]]`) or a standard Org mode link (`[[file:filename][Description]]`).
    -   *Example Usage:* "Create a link from the '[Source Note]' to the '[Target Note]'." "Identify potential connections between [Concept A] and [Concept B]."
-   **Tag:** Refers to an Org mode tag (`:tag_name:`) used for categorization and filtering notes.
    -   *Example Usage:* "Add the tag :[tag_name]: to the '[Note Title]' note." "Find notes with the tag :[tag_name]:."
-   **Property:** Refers to Org mode properties (`:PROPERTY: value`) used to store metadata about a note.
    -   *Example Usage:* "Set the property :[PROPERTY_NAME]: with value '[value]' on the '[Note Title]' note."
-   **Content:** Refers to the text and structure within a note (headings, paragraphs, lists, code blocks, etc.).
    -   *Example Usage:* "Expand on the section '[Heading Name]' in the '[Note Title]' note." "Refine the explanation of [Concept] in this note."

**Standard Communication Patterns/Requests:**

-   **Initiating Exploration:** "Let's explore [New Topic]." "Explain the concept of [Concept Name]."
-   **Initiating Exploitation:** "How can we apply [Concept] to [Problem/Context]?" "Find connections between [Note A] and [Note B] regarding [Specific Aspect]."
-   **Note Creation:** "Create a new note titled '[Note Title]' about [Brief Description]."
-   **Content Addition/Refinement:** "Add the following information to the '[Note Title]' note: [Information]." "Improve the clarity of the [Section Name] section in '[Note Title]'."
-   **Linking:** "Link '[Note A]' to '[Note B]' because [Reason]." "Suggest notes that could be linked to '[Current Note]'."
-   **Tagging:** "Tag '[Note Title]' with :[tag1]: and :[tag2]:." "What tags would be appropriate for this note?"
-   **Querying (Raj's primary tool, but Aider can assist):** "Summarize the key points from notes tagged :[tag_name]:." "List notes linked to '[Specific Note]'."
-   **External Resource Integration:** See the protocol below.
-   **Review/Verification (Raj's primary tool):** "Review the draft for '[Note Title]' for accuracy and style."

* External Resource Integration Protocol

This protocol describes the steps for incorporating information from external URLs (websites, articles, etc.) into the knowledge graph.

1.  **Raj Initiates:** Raj provides a URL and specifies the primary topic or purpose for integrating the resource.
    -   *Example Request:* "Please integrate information from this URL: [URL] about [Topic]." or "Summarize the key arguments from [URL] and add them to the '[Related Note Title]' note."
2.  **Aider Processes:** Aider will attempt to access and process the content of the provided URL.
    -   Aider will extract key information relevant to the specified topic or purpose (e.g., main points, definitions, examples, arguments).
    -   Aider will propose an integration strategy:
        -   Create a new note summarizing the resource.
        -   Add the information as a section or points within an existing relevant note.
        -   Suggest relevant existing notes to link to.
3.  **Aider Drafts:** Based on the proposed strategy, Aider will draft the initial Org mode content.
    -   This draft will include the extracted information, formatted according to our Documentation Style.
    -   A link to the original external URL will always be included in the note (e.g., `[[URL][Source]]`).
4.  **Raj Reviews and Refines:** Raj reviews the drafted content provided by Aider.
    -   Raj verifies the accuracy and relevance of the extracted information.
    -   Raj refines the text for clarity, conciseness, and integration with existing knowledge.
    -   Raj adds internal links (`[[roam:ID]]`) to connect the new content to other relevant notes in the graph.
    -   Raj adds appropriate tags (`:tag:`) to the note or section.
    -   Raj finalizes the placement and structure of the content within the graph.

* Documentation Style

This section defines the preferred style for documenting knowledge within the org-roam graph to ensure consistency and readability.

- Use clear and concise language.
- Structure notes logically using Org mode headings and lists.
- Employ Org mode formatting (bold, italics, code blocks) where appropriate.
- Ensure links (`[[link]]`) are used to connect related notes.
- Use tags (`:tag:`) consistently for categorization and filtering.
- Include source information or references where applicable.
- Keep paragraphs relatively short.

* Guardrails and Optimal Usage

This section outlines principles and practices to ensure effective and safe collaboration and knowledge building.

- **Focus:** Stay focused on the defined scope of building the knowledge graph and exploring its application.
- **Verification:** Raj is responsible for verifying the accuracy of information provided by Aider, especially for critical knowledge.
- **Clarity:** Raj should provide clear and specific requests to Aider. Aider should ask for clarification if a request is ambiguous.
- **Iteration:** Knowledge building is iterative. We will refine notes and connections over time.
- **Ethical Considerations:** Avoid documenting or discussing sensitive, private, or harmful information.
- **Tooling:** Leverage Org mode and org-roam features effectively for linking, tagging, and querying.
- **Version Control:** Commit changes frequently with clear commit messages.
