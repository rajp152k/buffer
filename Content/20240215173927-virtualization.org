A form of [[id:20230715T174319.700414][mapping]] that allows one to simulate something via [[id:d9a3aabe-114b-43c6-81f9-ca6e01ed3f46][Software]].
This something can be compute, storage or networking [[id:a9430614-4e6e-41ff-9788-0f51c2867e74][Hardware]].

The Major Pro of virtualization is allowance of hardware Uniformity and easier Replicability of software.

* Hypervisor
This is the software responsible for the indirection of resources into symbolic units in the virtualized machines. Two basic types:

** Type 1 (Bare metal)
 - directly communicate with the hardware
 - eg: KVM
** Type 2 (Hosted)
 - layered between host OS and the virtualized machines
 - eg: VMWare, VirtualBox, etc
