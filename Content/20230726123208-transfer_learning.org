* Basics 
 - pick an existing model trained on some dataset
 - adapt the model to another dataset that is distributionally different from the original one
 - for instance, fine tuning a semantic segmentation model trained on roads in Europe, on roads in India.

Elaborating..
** for Neural Networks
 1. build a deep model on the original dataset
 2. compile a much smaller labeled dataset for tuning to the final model
 3. remove some final layers from the first model (should have an embedding layer as final now)
 4. replace the removed layers with new layers that'll adapt to the new dataset and problem
 5. "freeze" the parameters of the initial layers of the base first model
 6. use the smaller labeled dataset to train the parameters of the new final layers (forwards and gradient descent)
