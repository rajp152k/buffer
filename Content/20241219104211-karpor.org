* Context
 - https://github.com/KusionStack/karpor/discussions/675
 - https://github.com/KusionStack/karpor/issues/658
 - https://github.com/mark3labs/mcphost/issues/4
** Logs
*** 0x2331 etcd - go client
 - need to find out how and what to expose of etcd
*** 0x2331 mcp-cli mcp-go
 - this combo worked and was able to successfully execute my requiremnents.
 - setting up a local mcp-cli array of servers they are quite useful
 - instead of npx or uvx, will only have to rely on go run instead
*** 0x2331 CLI client-host interaction
 - mcp-cli working with usual servers (tested on sqlite)
 - now need to build one in golang for etcd and elasticdb
 - mcp-golang and mcp-go are the two libraries that I'm thinking of working with
*** 0x2329 decoupled dev
 - building in components
 - local elastic and local etcd
 - MCP server over those
 - MCP client (start with mcp-cli) to interact with those
*** 0x2326 Dev Setup Build up
 - will checkout the official inspector tomorrow and read up on community recommendations when building with mcp
 - also write some with mcp-go (mcp-golang had some issues)
*** 0x2325 Spec Readup
 - https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/
*** 0x2325 Project Init
 - init chronologically descending logs for karpor contribs
 - [[id:f6f7f087-b7fe-4192-8950-497166f5af0f][model context proctol]] integration into the stack is what I'm going for
 - Draws parallels to [[id:b06cd83f-e2f6-4573-beda-8ebc26724bd1][Language Server Protocol]]
* Notes
** Server to Client Offerings
 - Context + data (for model and user)
 - Prompts: templated messages and workflows for users
 - Tools: Functions for AI model to execute
** Client to Server Offerings
 - Sampling: Server-initiated agentic behaviors and recursive LLM interactions
** Design Principles
 - https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/architecture/#design-principles
