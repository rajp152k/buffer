Given the timeline that one is born in, several great ideas may be taken for granted.

Notions like [[id:549c09af-11c0-4d71-98ea-44ac8db76ca9][Electricity]], [[id:9ad4eb80-8a65-4708-8cbe-8647cf918ab2][Heat]], [[id:f643219f-3e04-4e95-879f-d932d29029e1][Gravity]] are omnipresent and ubiquitous but, speaking perceptually, they're also very rare if one doesn't take the time to increase their awareness about such concepts.

Existential Ubiquity leads to Perceptual Rarity. We might also casually shun the effort than went into establishing such foundational principles that surround us.
