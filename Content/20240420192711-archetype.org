Inheriting from the base type that an [[id:20240114T203847.960609][Agent]] is.

Being able to take on different archetypes on demand is a valuable skill. It helps you with:
 - comprehending a domain from multiple perspectives, managing blind spots and biases that one archetype might exhibit.
 - multiple degrees of freedom when it comes to dealing with a particular action, that is, better structuring and understanding your own incentives.
