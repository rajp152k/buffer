#+title: Swarm Networks
#+filetags: :meta:

* Overview
** *Definition:*
  - Swarm Networks involve the collective behavior of decentralized and self-organized systems. Typically, the term is inspired by [[id:2ac1cb5c-fd21-41a7-a30a-d6a2080d973e][biological systems]] such as ant colonies, bird flocking, or fish schooling.

** *Characteristics:*
  - Distributed control without a centralized authority.
  - Robustness to errors and failures due to redundancy across the network.
  - Scalability allows the network to grow in size without a linear increase in complexity.

** *Applications:*
  - [[id:f1ec552e-a7c4-47ae-9dd2-a23733d1da92][Robotics]]: Swarm robotics utilize multiple robots to achieve tasks collectively that individual units cannot accomplish alone.
  - Telecommunications: Network protocols can leverage swarm intelligence for routing and data dissemination.
  - Optimization Problems: Algorithms like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) resolve complex computational problems by simulating swarm behaviors.

** *Technologies in Use:*
  - [[id:b8f679c7-3ac1-48d7-b1b5-8e4743a62767][IoT]] devices often utilize principles of swarm intelligence to manage network traffic effectively.
  - Blockchain technology can leverage swarm principles for decentralized consensus mechanisms.

** *Challenges:*
  - Coordination and communication overhead in large-scale networks.
  - Security threats due to the decentralized nature and potential for malicious entities to disrupt operations.
