** Deductive
 - given a set of assertions, to be able to deduce a conclusion with certainty
 - math is deductive
 - this isn't ampliative : no increase in human knowledge
** Inductive
 - given specific observations, generate a generalized conclusion that is likely, but may not certainly be, true.
 - is ampliative : can help predict patterns that otherwise wouldn't be noticed - increases human knowledge
** Abductive
 - given an incomplete set of information, try to come up with the most likely conclusion - this is, often, incomplete.
 - Most creativity can be captured by Abductive thinking and this also contributes the most to human knowledge : Abductive reasoning followed by verification/rejection via experiments.
 - think about the thought of devising a thought-experiment...
