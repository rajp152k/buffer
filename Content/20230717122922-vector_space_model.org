In the context of [[id:20230713T110240.846573][Representation Learning]],[[id:3f69fc50-5e0b-4bbd-8909-ee777434a1f5][Text Representation]].., feature engineering involves representing data numerically for [[id:20230713T110006.406161][Machine Learning]] algorithms to be able to process the said data.

* Properties

Some useful features of vector spaces that can employed in devising algorithms (non-exhaustive):
 - The notion of distance between two vectors
 - The notion of similarity between two vectors (cosine, etc)
 - Orthogonality to denote independence
 - projections onto hyperplanes
 - maps to higher dimensional spaces

* Vector Visualization

Visualizing vectors w.r.t each other in a set might provide important insights regarding the dataset (could be images, text, speech, etc) that they represent.
