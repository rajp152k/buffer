* Misc
** Sleep
 - sleeping when seated is something that I'd like to learn
   - a 15 min nap with good posture would be great when at work.
   - not talking about meditation
 - whenver I get into REM though, the spine relaxes and the head free falls if my neck is unsupported (which is how I work).
   - https://homelyville.com/how-to-sleep-sitting-in-chair/
 - this could be a good candidate for how quickly one gets into  REM phase -> just start a timer and try sleeping.
   - you start dreaming, your head falls ahead and you snap awake with a chuckle.
 - buddhist monks are said to be able to do so but I'm not sure if they are a fair comparison given their dream yoga practices.
