* Overview

- *Definition*: DNS, or Domain Name System, is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the [[id:24f4040a-7c18-416a-8460-e69280d437bf][Internet]] or a private network.

- *Function*: It translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into [[id:d799bc90-5032-4a69-9806-83145297a335][IP addresses]] (like 192.0.2.1), which are required for locating and identifying computer services and devices.

- *Components*:
  - *Domain Names*: Structured in levels (e.g., .com, example.com, www.example.com).
  - *DNS Records*: Various types of records (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, etc.) that store the mappings between domain names and IP addresses or other information.
  - *DNS Servers*:
    - *Recursive Resolvers*: Handle incoming requests from clients.
    - *Root Name Servers*: The starting point for DNS resolution.
    - *TLD (Top-Level Domain) Servers*: Manage the last part of the domain name (like .com, .org).
    - *Authoritative Name Servers*: Provide the actual IP address of the queried domain.

- *Importance*:
  - *Usability*: Facilitates web browsing by allowing users to access websites using easy-to-remember names.
  - *Email Delivery*: Helps route emails by translating domain names in email addresses to IP addresses.
  - *Load Distribution*: DNS can aid in distributing the load among multiple servers through techniques like round-robin DNS.

- *Security Considerations*: Vulnerable to attacks such as DNS spoofing or [[id:c8a3e246-0f29-4909-ab48-0d34802451d5][cache]] poisoning. Mechanisms like DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) are implemented to mitigate such risks.

*Connections*   :
- DNS serves as a crucial infrastructure underpinning the entire internet ecosystem, connecting web addressing (URLs) to machine addressing (IP addresses).
- The relationship between domain names and IP addresses highlights the need for effective and secure directory services in the networking domain.

* DNS Query Life Cycle

- *DNS Query Initiation*:
  - User inputs a URL in a web browser (e.g., www.example.com).
  - The browser checks the local cache for the IP address associated with the domain.

- *Local Cache Check*:
  - If found, the IP address is used to establish a connection.
  - If not found, the query proceeds to the next step.

- *DNS Resolver*:
  - The query is sent to a DNS resolver (typically provided by the user's ISP).
  - The resolver checks its own cache for the requested domain.

- *Root Name Servers*:
  - If there’s no cached result, the resolver queries a root name server.
  - The root server responds with a referral to the appropriate top-level domain (TLD) server (e.g., .com, .org).

- *TLD Name Servers*:
  - The resolver queries the TLD name server for the domain.
  - The TLD server responds with a referral to the authoritative name server for the domain.

- *Authoritative Name Servers*:
  - The resolver queries the authoritative name server.
  - The authoritative server provides the final answer, returning the IP address for the requested domain.

- *Response to User*:
  - The resolver caches the IP address for future queries and sends the IP address back to the user’s browser.
  - The browser uses this IP address to establish a connection to the web server.

- *Connection Establishment*:
  - The browser initiates a [[id:8bfeed3e-5930-4a61-9ffb-1459b2bcfcdc][TCP connection]] to the server using the retrieved IP address.
  - It then sends an HTTP request to access the website content.

*** Connections Between Entities:

1. *User Input and Local Cache*: The efficiency of the DNS system starts with the user’s request and heavily relies on caching to reduce latency in accessing frequent domains.

2. *DNS Resolver and DNS Servers*: The resolver acts as an intermediary, bridging the user and various DNS servers, thereby centralizing the querying process.

3. *Root Name Servers and TLD Servers*: Each level of servers represents a hierarchical structure that systematically narrows down requests, ensuring organized distribution of [[id:2e03b5e6-6fdb-49d9-ae49-e86ea8b68338][DNS records]].

4. *Authoritative Servers and Final Resolution*: The authoritative server is crucial as it holds the definitive answer about the IP address, solidifying its role in the DNS resolution process.
