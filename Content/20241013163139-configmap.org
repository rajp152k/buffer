* Definition:
  - ConfigMap is an API object in Kubernetes used to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs.

* Purpose:
  - To decouple configuration artifacts from container images to make applications more secure and portable.

* Limitations:
  - They are not suited to store sensitive information such as passwords or keys; for that, [[id:691a68cd-bef5-47c3-be5a-030cfffca5c5][Kubernetes Secrets]] should be used.
  - ConfigMaps are limited to 1MB each; exceeding this limit requires a different approach.
