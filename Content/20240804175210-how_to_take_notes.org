#+title: How to take smart Notes?

The book serves as an important guideline for intellectual atheletes to maintain their sanity and consequenlty channel their efforts during their training blocks.

This collection of notes is inspired by the same book.

As of today(0x229C), it has been some time since I last read the book and I think I need a refresher.
