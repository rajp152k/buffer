#+title: A/B testing

* Overview
** *Definition*:
  - A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a method of comparing two versions of a web page, application, or product feature to determine which one performs better in achieving a specific goal.

** *Components*:
  - *Control Group (A)*: The original version being tested.
  - *Variant Group (B)*: The modified version where some changes have been made.
  - *Metrics*: Quantifiable data points used to evaluate the performance, such as conversion rates, click-through rates, or user engagement metrics.

** *Process*:
  - *Hypothesis Formation*: Define what change you believe will improve the outcome.
  - *Design*: Create alternate versions (A and B) of the element to be tested.
  - *Randomization*: Users are randomly assigned to either version A or B to ensure fairness and reliability of the test results.
  - *Data Collection*: Gather data on how users interact with both versions.
  - *Analysis*: Use statistical methods to determine if the observed differences are significant.

** *Statistical Significance*:
  - This refers to the likelihood that the results of the test are not due to random chance. P-values and confidence intervals are often used to assess this.

** *Tools and Software*:
  - Common tools include Google Optimize, Optimizely, and Adobe Target, among others, which facilitate the execution and analysis of A/B tests.

** *Applications*:
  - Used extensively in web design, marketing campaigns, product development, and UX/UI design.

** *Limitations*:
  - *Sample Size Constraints*: Too small sample sizes may not yield significant results.
  - *Time and Resources*: Testing can be time-consuming and require substantial resources.
  - *External Validity*: Results may not always generalize beyond the specific setting or population tested.

** Connections:
- The success of A/B testing largely depends on correctly identifying impactful changes.
- It requires a balanced approach to data collection and analysis, ensuring that randomization and statistical interpretations are executed properly.
- Tools are integral for managing the complexity and scale of A/B tests, especially as the number of tests or user groups increases.
