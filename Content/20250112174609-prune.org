I'm deliberately undisciplined with what I dump in here.

Here are some pruning measures I take from time to time so that I can be more undisciplined later down the line.

This is a work in progress

* Refactoring Sub-Nodes to Nodes
 - helps depopulate the central node from specific links
* Building Lists/indexes
 - helps create a psuedo domain view
 - the central node is formed by projections of multiple other domains.
* Shorten what's been said
 - cut away until what remains is [[id:4fbcb747-0e1c-4fb3-99dd-1e05787b41f2][conceptually exhaustive]].
