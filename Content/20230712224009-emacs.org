* Stream 
** 0x2178
 - I already use vim bindings in emacs but I do miss the command line
 - have decided to go minimal for my work and retain emacs for personal projects and writing
 - reading up on the unix philosophy and aiming to become a true shell ninja.
 - knowing about Unix operating system does excite me and do hope to learn a lot more
 - I'll definitely never give up emacs but a basic awareness of the operating system with the utilities of a CLI do encourage me to get good at both ecosystems
 - starting a similar [[id:8bc9d1c6-da56-4db9-a904-8f052e6836cb][Vim]] stream to log all my works, I'll be keeping the vimrc simple this time and not be using a lot of external plugins but rely on the vanilla features of vim
 - already excited about getting back to a dark green terminal screen..
** 0x2127
 - youtube video on navigating the text editing landscape
   - on why one should not settle even in 2023
 - starting with the skills necessary to efficiently edit text
   - touch typing -> efficient navigation (vim) -> playing with the nuts and bolts (emacs)
     - why not VS code?
** 0x211F
 - thinking of writing and emacs extension
   - visualizing my knowledge graph in an interactive manner
   - existing extensions do exist but it would be a good experience building it from scratch
   - will be proceeding formally and take it up as a proper initiative
** 0x211E
Started using smudge (spotify on emacs) : more time in emacs...
Thinking of summarizing my init.el in a blog : been around 2-3 years since I last did that 
** 0x2118
The single greatest tool choice I've ever made in terms of editing efficiently (right along side vim : I use Evil GccEmacs 28 as of now)
