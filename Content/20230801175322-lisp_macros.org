#+title: lisp macros
#+filetags: :lisp:

* Abstract
 - Macros are special functions that transform an input lisp form with custom semantics to valid lisp forms.
 - This transformation is generally an expansion (I'm not aware of syntax contractions) and is addressed as a macro-expansion.
 - they don't evaluate their args completely but transform them into lisp forms that can be evaluated.
 - macro chaining is a thing : incf expands to setf which in turn uses the primitive setq.
