* Overview


Salts are random strings of data added to passwords before hashing to prevent pre-computed tables ([[id:76c14922-1be9-4c69-bb3a-302edc7b6b89][rainbow tables]]) from cracking them.

*How they work:*

1.  User creates password.
2.  System generates unique salt.
3.  Salt is combined with password (e.g., appended).
4.  Combined value is hashed (e.g., using [[id:89d7166b-f925-43d0-a74b-bcd53cdeab26][bcrypt]] or Argon2).
5.  Salt and hash are stored.

*Caveats:*

-   Salts must be unique per user/password.
-   Salt length should be cryptographically secure (e.g., 16 bytes).
-   Salts don't protect against weak passwords or brute-force attacks on individual accounts.

*Example:*

-   *Without salt:*  =password= might always hash to  =5f4dcc3b...=.
-   *With salt:*  =salt1password=  hashes to  =a1b2c3d4...= while  =salt2password=  hashes to  =e5f6g7h8...=, making rainbow tables ineffective.
