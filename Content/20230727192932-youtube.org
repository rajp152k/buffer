- there are phases to a good video
- pre-prod, prod and post-prod
- all the scripting, planning, and ideation comes in preprod
- the actual shooting and collection of all clips needed comes is prod
- the final collation of all in those clips is post prod
- checkout [[id:c3228445-00c4-4451-a0cc-b8742673753d][video processing]]

- need to understand how I could document my current learning pursuits well
- feel like I need to master relatively shorter formats (thinking 5 minutes tops)
  - video editing will be a necessary skill and a script will be mandatory as well to pack in as much content as possible to make it work for the reader.
- will be focusing on technical and intellectual stuff initially and will start to work on branding my online presence a particular way
- do wish to gain a decent viewership and actually provide value for them rather than capitalising on trends

 - initializing an iteration on my creation process
 - will be recording all feedback and relevant 
** (0x2122) YT Init : Incentives and Plans
*** History
- second youtube channel
- first -> to practice rhetoric
- did help with working out the kinks in my communication skills
*** Abstract
- writing a pretty good way to express yourself and show your work
- albeit.., still incomplete : videos complement the process of expression
- speaking into a camera, speaking from experiences, tricks you into thinking you're addressing a large audience - a pretty neat trick, I would say
- I'm starting again with a slightly formal approach : https://www.youtube.com/@rajp152k 
*** Settling into a Niche
- Some topics that I'll explore initially:
    - Emacs -> instructive/customization
    - Common Lisp -> instructive
    - Programming Language Theory (Racket)
    - Book Reviews/follow-throughs (non-fiction/technical)
    - Interesting Research from different domains
    - Workflows, tools for relevant tasks
    - the occasional philosophical rant
*** The Long Term Plan
- freedom of expression is a given
- being free enough to express is what we generally lack...
- targeting at least a video a week..
