#+title: Dynamic Typing
#+filetags: :plt:cs:

* Overview

- *Definition*: Dynamic typing refers to a programming language feature where variable types are determined at runtime rather than at compile-time.

- *Languages*: Common languages that support dynamic typing include Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and PHP.

- *Type Flexibility*: In dynamically typed languages, the same variable can refer to different data types at different points in the execution of a program.

- *Error Handling*: Type-related errors may only surface during execution, potentially leading to runtime exceptions that are not caught during compilation.

- *Development Speed*: Dynamic typing can lead to faster development cycles since programmers don't need to explicitly declare variable types.

- *Advantages*:
  - Easier to write and modify code in a flexible manner.
  - Encourages rapid prototyping.

- *Disadvantages*:
  - Increased risk of runtime errors.
  - Potentially more difficult debugging and maintenance due to type ambiguity.

*** Connections

- *[[id:2e5ba623-bd64-4fbc-b800-1fa2c9e8adad][Static]] vs. Dynamic Typing*: Unlike static typing, where type checking is done at compile time (e.g., languages like Java and C++), dynamic typing prioritizes flexibility over type safety at runtime.

- *Impact on Performance*: Dynamic typing can introduce overhead because the type of each variable needs to be checked during execution, which might affect performance compared to statically typed languages.

- *Developer Efficiency*: While dynamic typing can speed up initial development, it can also lead to longer-term maintenance challenges, necessitating careful testing strategies.
