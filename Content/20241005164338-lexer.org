#+title: Lexer
#+filetags: :compiler:cs:

* Definition
    - A lexer, short for lexical analyzer, is a component of a compiler that converts sequences of characters (source code) into a sequence of tokens.
* Purpose
    - It simplifies the syntax analysis (parsing) phase of compiling by breaking down the syntax into manageable tokens.
* Functionality
    - Identifies valid tokens and their properties (e.g., keywords, identifiers, operators).
    - Removes insignificant elements such as whitespace and comments.
* Output
    - The sequence of tokens is typically input to a parser.
    - Tokens usually have attributes such as type and value.

* Relationship with Other Compiler Components
    - Parser
      - The parser utilizes tokens generated by the lexer to construct a parse tree, representing the hierarchical syntactic structure of the source code.
    - Syntax Error Handling
      - While the lexer simplifies token identification, the parser's task is more focused on syntax structure correctness.

* Approaches to Lexical Analysis
    - Regular Expressions
      - Lexers often employ regular expressions to specify patterns for tokens.
    - Tools
      - Lexical analyzers can be implemented via tools like Lex or Flex in C, which automatically generate lexer code from specified rules.
    - State Machines
      - Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) are commonly used to recognize patterns described by regular expressions.

* Critique and Considerations
    - Potential Complications
      - Complex lexeme rules may complicate lexer design, although this is usually mitigated by regular expressions and state machines.
    - Efficiency
      - Efficient handling of large code bases necessitates careful design to minimize overhead during tokenization.

* Further Questions
    - What specific languages or compilers are being explored or developed for in this context? More context would aid in addressing language-specific concerns.
    - Is there interest in knowing about specific lexer generator tools or advanced optimization techniques?
