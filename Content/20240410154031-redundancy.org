#+title: Redundancy
#+filetags: :sys:meta:


* Outline
** Types of Redundancy : Fault Tolerance, System Availability
*** Hardware Redundancy - duplicate components, failover systems
*** Software Redundancy - N-version programming, recovery blocks
*** Information Redundancy - error detection and correction codes
*** Time Redundancy - re-execution, checkpointing
** Benefits and Trade-offs : Mean Time To Repair, Mean Time Between Failures
*** Increased System Reliability - fault masking, error containment
*** Improved System Availability - reduced downtime, faster recovery
*** Increased System Complexity - added components, management overhead
*** Additional Resource Requirements - power, space, maintenance
** Applications and Examples : Aerospace, Finance, Healthcare
*** Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks (RAID) - data striping, mirroring
*** Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) - backup power, voltage regulation

* Conceptual Models
** Systems Theory & Cybernetics
*** States: Operational, Failed, Recovery
*** Inputs: Component status, repair signals
*** Processes: Fault detection, redundancy activation
*** Feedback Loops: System status monitoring, repair triggers

** Mathematical Modeling
*** Reliability Functions: Failure probability, hazard rate
*** Redundancy Models: k-out-of-n systems, standby redundancy

** Information Theory
*** Redundancy Measures: Code rate, error correction capability
*** Channel Model: Noisy channel, error probability

** Computer Science & Algorithmic Structures
*** Data Structures: Mirrored data, checksums
*** Fault-Tolerant Algorithms: Agreement protocols, Byzantine fault tolerance

** Control Theory
*** Controllers: Redundancy managers, failover controllers
*** Setpoints: Desired system state, availability targets
*** Observers: System state estimators, fault detectors

** Physics & Thermodynamics
*** Analogy: Redundant energy storage (batteries, capacitors)
*** Entropy: Information redundancy, error reduction
