* Book Notes
** Book recommendations: Steps to follow:
1. Gather all that you need to: Collation into a processing buffer
   - physical gathering
   - electronic gathering
     - notion, obsidian : too much : strat --> setup frame first, import gradually later on
   - mental scraping:
     - residues from things that you feel you need to do
2. Processing the buffer
   - top first : no preferences
   - follow the GTD Algorithm : no favourites
   - Only decision making : only decide the next step and immediately organize
   - The Processing Algo:
     1) No action now
     2) Action required
	- mostly the most immediate physical action that needs to be taken
	- If expected time < 2 mins : do it
	- else if you're not in the know for the optimal action : research or deligate
	- else schedule
3. Organizing requirements:
   1) Projects list 
   2) Project support material : hierarchical context and narrow down
   3) Calendared actions and information 
   4) Next actions list 
   5) "waiting for" list 
   6) Reference Material 
   7) "Someday/Maybe" List 
4. Reviews:
   - weekly reviews to keep the system healthy
