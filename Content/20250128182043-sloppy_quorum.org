* Overview

- *Definition of Sloppy [[id:20240519T200217.994784][Quorum]]*:
  - A system design pattern commonly used in distributed systems.
  - It allows for read or write operations to succeed even when some nodes in the cluster are down or unreachable.

- *Key Characteristics*:
  - Offers high [[id:cba21706-d0d4-4044-8cf1-cbafadad899f][availability]] and [[id:20240519T162542.805560][fault tolerance]].
  - Data replication across multiple nodes enhances resiliency.
  - Reduced consistency guarantees in exchange for availability.

- *The Role of Quorum*:
  - A traditional quorum requires a majority of nodes to respond for an operation to succeed.
  - Sloppy quorum relaxes this criterion, allowing operations to proceed with responses from fewer nodes or even from nodes that are not part of the intended quorum.

- *Use Cases*:
  - Often implemented in systems where speed and uptime are prioritized over strict consistency, such as in NoSQL databases.
  - Can be beneficial in managing transient failures or network partitions.

- *Trade-offs*:
  - While it improves availability, it may lead to stale reads or temporary inconsistencies in the system.
  - Use requires careful consideration of the acceptable level of inconsistency for the application in question.
