* Overview

- *Flynnâ€™s Taxonomy*:
  - A classification system for computer architectures developed by Michael J. Flynn in 1966.
  - Categorizes computer systems based on the number of concurrent instruction and data streams they can handle.

- *Four Categories of Flynn's Taxonomy*:
  1. *Single Instruction, Single Data (SISD)*:
     - A single processor executing a single instruction stream to operate on data stored in a single memory.
     - Traditional von Neumann architecture falls under this category.

  2. *Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD)*:
     - A single instruction stream controls multiple processing elements (PEs), each executing the same instruction on different pieces of data.
     - Used in applications like image processing and matrix operations.

  3. *Multiple Instruction, Single Data (MISD)*:
     - Multiple instruction streams operate on a single data stream.
     - Rarely used in practice but can be seen in certain fault-tolerant systems that employ redundancy.

  4. *Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data (MIMD)*:
     - Multiple processors with independent instruction and data streams.
     - Common in many modern multi-core and distributed systems.

- *Connections and Applications*:
  - *SISD* is typical in general-purpose computing.
  - *SIMD* is widely used in graphics processing units (GPUs) and vector processors for parallel processing tasks.
  - *MISD* finds niche applications in specialized fields like space systems where redundancy and fault tolerance are prioritized.
  - *MIMD* is favored in complex computing tasks that require high parallelism, like scientific computations and simulations.

** SPMD and MPMD

- Single Program, Multiple Data (SPMD):
  - A parallel computing model where multiple autonomous processors simultaneously execute the same program on different pieces of distributed data.
  - Often considered a subtype or an extension of the MIMD model.
  - Common in distributed computing environments like clusters and [[id:4dfc4edf-4222-4f6c-acce-edf8bf193ba4][supercomputers]], using frameworks such as [[id:f10899df-3d45-4290-bc50-b75c85bfb66b][MPI]] (Message Passing Interface).

- Multiple Program, Multiple Data (MPMD):
  - A parallel computing model where different processors execute different programs on different sets of data.
  - Suitable for heterogeneous computing environments where different tasks need to be carried out on various datasets.
  - Used in complex workflows where diverse processing is necessary; for example, different nodes might perform distinct roles in a larger distributed application.

- Connections and Evolution:
  - Both SPMD and MPMD can be implemented on MIMD architectures, which provides the flexibility to run diverse and complex workloads.
  - SPMD simplifies programming by using a single program logic across multiple datasets but still requires careful data synchronization.
  - MPMD offers greater flexibility at the potential cost of increased complexity in managing different program executions and coordinating data exchanges.
