* Abstract

 - I try finding good reading lists by first judging a fictional entities character and then consider what they would read to become that person.
 - A book enlistment that suggests what your favorite super-villain does sound very interesting and should be an interesting toy project.
 - A corpus of books is of-course needed for the same and could be a domain specific search engine in the long term
 - for starters, can be a youtube series that I run.
