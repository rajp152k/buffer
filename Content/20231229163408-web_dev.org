#+title: Web Dev
#+filetags: :programming:

Web development is the umbrella term for conceptualizing, creating, deploying and operating web applications and application programming interfaces for the Web.

As a result, will be diving deep into the principles of web development as well and tackle some skill issues that havne't been dealt with for quite some time.
