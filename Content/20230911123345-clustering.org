* Loss 

The nature of a clustering can be evaluated via multiple perspectives and their combinations. This leads to several loss functions that are losely based on the two major criteria:
 - larger Inter cluster distance is better
 - small Intra-cluser diameter is better

Some advanced metrics may even consider considering the shape of the clusters but I won't be exploring that here.
