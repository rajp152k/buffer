* Abstract

The machine (in the context of [[id:20230713T110006.406161][Machine Learning]]) lives in an environment and can interpret it's state in the form of a feature vector.

The machine can execute actions in these states and there are associated rewards with these actions which also alter the state.

The objective of a reinforcement learning algorithm is to learn a policy function, that, given the environment state, outputs an optimal (to maximize rewards) action to execute in that state.

The action is optimal if it maximizes the expected average reward.
