 - starting to think in terms of how live updates are managed for linux itself : think about the state being handled under /proc for instance

Everything is a file in [[id:f0f7ed1f-4117-46d1-91be-b921a2e5cab6][Unix]] based [[id:aba08b45-c41d-4bb4-9053-bc6dd8704444][Operating Systems]].

I want to be able to manage dynamic combinations configuration files as another file.

The changes in the constituents are immediately reflected in the corresponding view.

Single file views are simply links but complex combinations (partial line ranges or concats of multiple files) is something that I can't think about, yet

A quick google search led me to [[id:53b1ca31-b757-48a4-853b-5d7ae44184a8][Fuse]], going to investigate a little
