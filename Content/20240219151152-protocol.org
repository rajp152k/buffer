#+title: Protocol

This is a decently overlaoded term that varies in connotations across domains.

In the context of [[id:a4e712e1-a233-4173-91fa-4e145bd68769][Computer Networks]] for instance, these are the agreed upon standards that devices on a network communicate by (HTTP, TCP/IP, bitstreams in the physical layer)


Regardless of the specific context, protocols provide a predictable and organized way to enable:

 -  Interoperability: Different entities (devices, organizations, individuals) can interact smoothly as long as they all follow the same protocol.
 -  Reliability: Well-defined protocols create consistency and minimize errors in communication or procedures.
 -  Efficiency: Standardization allows for optimizations within the guidelines of a protocol.
