* Overview

- The scheduling component in Kubernetes is a core responsibility of the control plane.
- Assign pods to nodes ensuring optimal resource allocation and management.

* Primary Functionalities
** Resource Optimization
- Considers CPU, memory requests, and constraints.
** Affinity/Anti-affinity Rules
- Enables pod co-location or separation.
- https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity

** Taints and Tolerations
- Ensures nodes can repel certain pods unless explicitly tolerated.
- https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/
- good usecases:
  - tainted the nodes with GPUs and running GPU demanding pods on such nodes by adding tolerations
** NodeSelector and NodeAffinity
- Limits nodes that can host particular pods.
** Priorities and Preemption
- Ensures urgent pods get priority using preemption.
- https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-priority-preemption/#pod-priority

** Eviction
- https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/node-pressure-eviction/
- https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/api-eviction/
** Scheduler Algorithms:
    - Priority Functions: Rank nodes based on set criteria.
    - Predicate Functions: Determines if a pod can run on a particular node.
** Custom Schedulers:
    - Allows for user-defined policies and scheduling strategies.

** Pod Topology Spread Constraints
- https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/topology-spread-constraints/
* Kube-Scheduler
Two basic stages to allocating a pod to a node:
- Filtering : disqualify candidates
- Scoring : prioritize candidates
** Scheduling Policies
- configure predicates(for filtering) and Priorities(for scoring)
** Scheduling Profiles
- configure plugins that implement different scheduling stages:
  - QueueSort
  - Filter
  - Score
  - Bind
  - Reserve
  - Permit
* Scheduling Framework
The allocation of a pod is split in two phases:
 - Scheduling Cycle : Decides
 - Binding Cycle : applies the decision
* Resources
