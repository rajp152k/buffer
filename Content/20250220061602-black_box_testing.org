* Strategies
** [[id:34df7d47-1f78-4acf-8dd7-9c03e04e4a9d][Exception Handling]]
 - trying inducing all interface oriented errors to throw the program in an undefinable state when a exception handler kicks in and yields control back to the program
** Leveraging [[id:ca98597a-027f-4eda-bbb2-801b8f74d0a5][Side Effects]]
 - A lot of testing strategies rely on the fact that some routines may succeed in certain scenarios but not without side effects.
 - This leads to disturbed behaviours of certain other routines affected by that effect.
** Stress Testing Resources
 - testing the boundaries of resources' consumption by forcing them with certain inputs can induce certain architecture specific side effects, helping break the software
